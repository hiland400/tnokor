 POLITICS_ANARCHY_DESC:0 "Every few weeks, dozens of Luftwaffe bombers take off from airfields in German Südwestafrika, with their final destination being the skies above western Africa, hundreds of miles to the north. Their goal: to transform the Sahel into the surface of the Moon.\n\nMuch like the situation in western Russia, the Luftwaffe's strategic bombing is as much about terrorizing the locals as it is training new pilots and justifying ordinance budgets. Any man-made structure visible from the air, even a few ramshackle huts, quickly becomes designated as a training target and is pounded into dust by thousands of pounds of high-density explosives. A single nomad walking over the rocky plateaus finds himself attracting machine gun rounds like dung attracts flies. The result is that it is impossible for any country to lay claim to the territory — not that they'd find much there worth claiming, anyway. It is a lawless, uncivilized land, where the fiery hand of God constantly wipes the slate clean, and only those smart enough to escape or conceal themselves are able to survive. Perhaps civilization may once again flourish if the bombings cease, but few living in the wasteland bother speculating on such matters. Those with their head in the clouds are bound to lose it."
