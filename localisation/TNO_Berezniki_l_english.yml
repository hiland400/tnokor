 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0 "In 1917, many Russian nobles saw their dreams crushed in a single moment. Their belongings were taken away and their Motherland was stolen by the Bolshevik beasts, dooming them to a beggarly existence abroad. Suffering from longing for the Motherland, many emigrants and their children sought for a new ideology to follow instead of the failed reactionary ideals and many saw the future in the most consistent and radical anti-Communist ideology of the time - fascism. For Alexander Lvovich Kazembek, a son of a Russian noble of Azeri descent, the Russian model of Fascism was the only way forward to bridge the gap between the Tsar and the commoners and establish a Russian national power, based on class collaboration and Tsarist ideocracy. Kazembek and his fellow-minded peers united into the Union of Mladorossi, which, despite its eclecticism and youthful vigor, attracted many prominent Russian exiles.\n\nBut even Kazembek's admiration for Mussolini couldn't be nearly as controversial as his fascination - if not to say, sympathy - with the Soviet system. Recognizing the inherent rottenness of the Marxist ideology, he claimed that the Russian people digested the Bolshevik brutality and overcame it from the inside, with the Soviet government, for all its flaws, becoming a true representative of the national interests. Most expected was his stance against the Nazi invaders to the Soviet Union, although as his reputation among the emigrant circles faded and he had to leave for the United States, he could little to do to resist them.\n\nA faithful and loyal monarchist, Kazembek accompanied Emperor Vladimir III in his war against the WRRF, putting aside his reservations. After the war, he became the crown's representative in Berezniki, managing the daily affairs of the reclaimed Tsarist province and organizing the industrial work for the needs of the Empire. Despite his nominal allegiance to the Tsar, there is little doubt in his ambitions, as Kazembek has never abandoned his desire to see the triumph of people's monarchy."
