communist_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian socialism covers those who claim that a centralized one-party state is the way to lead a nation to true communism. The most common strain is Marxism-Leninism, coined to describe the teachings of the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin. Lenin and his Bolshevik party had the distinction of launching the first successful socialist revolution in 1918, when they overthrew the Russian Republic and proclaimed the Soviet Union. His ideology ascribed the absence of Marx's predicted revolutions to a lack of class consciousness; this would be remedied by an enlightened vanguard party, who would spearhead the revolution and educate the proletariat in their wake. Once the revolution was achieved, all political and economic power could be concentrated in a \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" which would eventually wither away once an industrial communist utopia was achieved.\n\nDespite their early success, the Soviets could do little to expand their ideology far beyond their borders. Their further failure to fulfill promises of modernization and industrialization, as well as the nation's utter collapse in the face of the Nazi invasion, have been cited by some as a failure of socialism, while more hardline Marxist-Leninists blamed the Soviet Union's shortcomings on not enough collective management by the state. From the 1940s onwards, Marxism-Leninism only saw significant support in underground movements, usually resistance cells in Nazi- or Japanese-occupied nations. Some have even been funded by the United States, hoping they could play socialism against fascism. But as socialists are fond of saying, \"the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we hang them.\""
socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Libertarian socialism refers to a broad coalition of those who claim ideological descent from Marx, but believe in the necessity of forceful revolution in order to achieve proletarian liberation. However, these strains of socialism also have disdain and distrust for strong authorities, seeing centralized state control of the means of production as subversion of Marxist ideology and fundamentally incompatible with the desired end goal of communism. In its place, they tend to have a strong emphasis on decentralized systems of power, localism, and direct democracy. Libertarian socialists also tend to overlap with other anti-authoritarian leftist movements, including anarchism, syndicalism, communalism, and left-wing libertarianism, and its calls for decentralization make it the preferred ideology of trade unions, labor councils, and other local workers' organizations.\n\nAlthough libertarian socialism saw a brief flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it could do little to secure long-term power. From the streets of Paris, to the hills of Mexico, to the alleys of Barcelona, they were born in the aftermath of bloody wars, and their flames burned hot but short. Many times, they were crushed by the states they sought to overthrow, or became locked in self-destructive feuds with ideological rivals. Of the rebellions that did succeed, they were often supplanted by more authoritarian leaders that transformed their countries into dictatorships. And with the rise of fascism, it seemed as if socialists' hopes in the West were dashed forever. But to socialists, defeats are merely a temporary delay of the inevitable..."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an umbrella term covering leftist movements that still wish to operate within a mostly capitalist framework. Proponents of Social Democracy still believe in markets, the ability of an individual to run a business and manage others as employees, and in the freedom to earn and spend money, while also advocating for vast social programs like welfare, free and public healthcare, shelter for the homeless, and good minimum wages among many others.\n\nWhile decidedly on the left end of the political spectrum, followers of Social Democracy and those of other leftist ideologies like Communism and traditional Socialism generally dislike each other, and they rarely intermingle or work together. Social Democrats do not advocate for the revolution and radical rebuilding of the system that their further-left counterparts do, and are more accepting of various other democratic ideologies."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Liberal democracy can trace its roots back to the philosophies of John Locke. Locke first and foremost believed that all people on the planet are entitled to natural rights, consisting of life, liberty, and property. He also believed that citizens create a social contract with the nation they live in, defining the state as something that exists solely to protect its citizenry, and must use its powers to do so. Therefore, a nation can only rule from the consent of the governed and must use their position to protect and advance the rights of the people.\n\nLiberalism sprouts from the idea that social progress and equality can be brought upon not by violence and revolution, but instead through the creation of laws and policies. These liberals believe in the democratic process, and are willing to work with political enemies in order to achieve their goals, including universal suffrage, universal education, property rights, and the advancement of marginalized populations. Alongside this, they strongly support capitalism and free trade while also believing that governmental oversight is necessary for a healthy economy and safe populace.\n\nDue to the rise of fascism and other right-wing extremist ideologies, many free nations have drifted towards liberalism, and many people see it as the most sane way to counteract such a dramatic shift in the world."

social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservative Democracy, known more commonly as Conservatism, is the wing within democratic nations that tends to rely more on tried-and-true ideas, traditional values, and varying degrees of nationalism. Conservatives are generally more opposed to change in both culture and law, and for those changes they do approve of they tend to advocate for more gradual implementation.\n\nHowever, proponents of this ideology differ from more radical traditionalists in that they still believe fervently in some form of democratic process, and believe that the people will choose the path towards traditionalism in elections rather than it being needed to be forced on them by an oppressive regime. Conservatives like these will usually concede defeat if they are defeated by a vote and are more willing to work with other parties and ideologies."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy refers less to a specific ideology and more to a situation where a democratic system exists, but there is a strong central authority that consistently has the power to overrule it as they please. It may be freshly born, like a slowly liberalizing autocracy where the ruler is reluctant to fully cede power to the masses just yet, or it may be the last stage of a democracy's life, like a president consolidating influence at the expense of other branches of the government. It can be tumultuous, such as in the wake of a military coup, or fairly stable, in the case of long-running semi-absolute monarchies.\n\nThe defining feature of an authoritarian democracy is always a strongman leader, be it a president, general, or monarch. They ostensibly rule by the people's will and for the people's sake, but they are often entrenched well enough in their positions (or have the backing of the military) where the people could never hope to dislodge them peacefully. This regime also lends itself to kleptocracies and corruption, where the leader enriches themselves, their family, and close friends with the nation's coffers."
despotism_subtype_desc:0 "Despotism is a wide-reaching term that encompasses governmental systems where power is concentrated on a single individual or group of individuals. These people run the nation according to their own will, and almost always make heavy use of the military and the police to keep their citizens from revolting. Despotist governments very rarely tolerate other ideologies and when they do they have systems in place to prevent those groups from ever gaining power. Opposition forces are treated as enemies of the state and heavily repressed, and if elections are ever held they are either completely rigged lies or for positions with no power.\n\nDespotist governments also usually wish to establish control or dominance over other nations, and maintain extensive militaries to use in conquest and to protect the regime. While Despotists can use nationalism as a reason for their authority, they are not as nationalistic as Fascists and National Socialists and nationalism is usually more of an excuse than any real part of the agenda."
fascism_subtype_desc:0 "Of the ideologies that emerged in the tumult following the First World War, the one that proved to have the greatest success in achieving and maintaining power in Europe was the ideology known as fascism. Borne out of the beliefs of disillusioned communists and authoritarian nationalists, fascism is often characterized as being \"third positionist\" due to its ideological inspiration from both the radical left and right. Although traces of Marxist doctrine can still be found buried in its worldview - it embraces a producer-parasite dialectic, but between nations instead of economic classes - its virulent nationalism puts it at odds with the internationalist mindset of socialism, and it inevitably led to violent conflict within Germany, Spain, and Italy in the interbellum decades. In all cases, the fascist parties eventually won out and forced their socialist rivals underground.\n\nFascism's most defining qualities come from its slavish devotion to the state. The government, often under the control of a single strongman, serves as the final arbitrator and authority in the land. Religious institutions, trade unions, private businesses, and the like are permitted to exist in some limited form, though their subservience to the state's authority is made clear. The government also upholds a national mythos, spinning tales of a noble people with past glories that were unfairly stripped from them, and demands that the populace find strength in unity and reclaim what was lost. They sneer at liberal nations for decadent complacency and socialist nations for succumbing to degeneracy - yet paradoxically view those outsiders as a looming threat who are posed to destroy everything they hold dear."
burgundian_system_subtype_desc:0 "When Germany's luck began running out after the Second World War, the most fanatical members of the Nazi Party - chief among them Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler - sought to reconcile their beliefs in the superiority of national socialism with the increasingly bleak reality unfolding before them. They eventually arrived at the conclusion that the Nazi Party had lost sight of itself and had collapsed into decadence, and that only they were fit to preserve the ideology as truly intended. They increasingly isolated themselves from the Third Reich's political structures, secretively building their own systems in parallel. When Himmler was made head of the SS-Ordenstaat Burgundy, he began implementing his vision unimpeded.\n\nMuch like how many of Nazism's goals revolve around Hitler's increasingly erratic statements, the tenets of the Burgundian System are equally ill-defined: the only way one could begin to define it is to analyze Himmler's increasingly inscrutable actions and cryptic beliefs, which very few outside of the system are able to do. What is clear is that his regime implements Nazi policies in the extreme: the Party is exalted above all other aspects of society, draconian racial supremacy laws are harshly enforced, and Nazi thought is deliberately incorporated into every aspect of waking life. It also impresses a spartan and military-esque lifestyle upon the entire population, in hopes of removing all potential sources of decadence or complacency."
national_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "National Socialism, the iron fist clutching the heart of Europe for nearly thirty years, refers to the various styles of fascism which incorporate fervent racism, extreme militarism, and a  totalitarian, one-party state where individuals subordinated for the common good. It is distinct from other forms of fascism in it's core tenets of brutally enforced racial hierarchy and aggressive, genocidal expansionism as "living space" for its nation's peoples.\n\nIn the German sense, Nazism holds several key tenants close to it's black heart- anti-Semitism ingrained in every political action; A deep disdain for traditional liberal democracies, the parliamentary system and capitalism; and finally it's strong hatred for Communism. While most National Socialist nations are either with or direct collaborators with the German Reich, the term is now often used to describe a variety of fascist movements around the world which echo Nazism's foundations, each with their own unique attributes, such as radical Japanese imperialism."
ultranational_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Ultranationalism is a vicious blend of rabid militarism and fervent devotion to the nation above all else. Ultranationalists are keen to purge their nations of perceived foreign influence of any sort. Thus they favour autarky, stratification and a strong military involvement in everyday affairs to insure that the country is kept independent and \"safe from outside corruption\". The idea of a glorious state is the key to all things for the ultranationalist, and they will call upon images from the past to stir up and inspire in combination with a paranoid and savage hatred of the other and the outsider. Racism and other forms of discrimination are weaved into all parts of life, to further raise up and separate the ideal countryman from those that do not fit in. In order to make truth of their promises of the \"great nation\", ultranationalism presents the military as the ultimate tool for prosperity and greatness. Service to the state in this manner is therefore mandatory for most and deeply glorified as a part of the nation's triumph over the rest of the world. Ultranationalism has often manifested as part of a desire for revenge against foreign enemies and uses this desire to drive the nation forward. While some differences are known to exist between each ultranationalist movement, they never differ in their mad desperation to see eternal glory rain down upon their lands."
