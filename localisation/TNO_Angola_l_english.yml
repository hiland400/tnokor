 COUNTRY_INFO_ZENTRALAFRIKA:0 "많은 이들은 중앙아프리카를 독일령 아프리카의 알짜배기라고 생각했다. Zentralafrika is regarded by many to be the crown jewel of German Afrika. One of the few profitable RK's in the Reich, the former Congo region is coated with plantations and factories. From rubber, to diamonds, to uranium -- the vast wealth of the Congo is being exploited to its fullest by the Reich here. In the jungles, the sound of rifle fire cracks through the air on a regular basis- not because of any war, of course, but from the hunting exploits of Reichskommissar and media darling Siegfried Müller, the man who has made this all happen. Beloved at home, Müller has gently guided Zentralafrika to the massive profits it makes today, using a light grip to push the region forward into a new dawn. Every month, new stories of his exploits in the jungles of Afrika headline the papers of the Reich, the text praising the adventurer hero of all Aryans. If you were to ask any average layperson about the Reichskommissars that run their Reich, chances are they would only be able to name Müller, and they would heap him with praise. With Müller's expert handling and the efficient exploitation of Afrika's riches, Zentralafrika is certainly doing its part to bring the Reich forward into a glorious age.\n\nAt least, that is what Germany thinks.\n\nIn truth, Zentralafrika is neither profitable, nor peaceful, nor efficient. It may be the complete opposite of all three. Yes, the Reichskommissariat makes incredible amounts of money -- but only a fraction service the Reich. Instead, most service foreign merchants pinching a profit, or cutthroat mercenaries plying their trade, or unassuming clerks and politicians engaged in a convoluted web of graft and embezzlement. Neither are Zentralafrika's profits clean: any product stamped with Leopoldville's insignias were found, taken, and made by millions of slaves. Their blood and sweat slicks the money that flows to and from the Congo Sea.\n\nNeither is Müller a hero of Germany; in fact, he may be the closest a German can be to a traitor. His administrative style, described as "light-handed", would be more accurately described as "non-existent". Siegfried is more than happy to allow his subordinates to run the colony in his stead while he gallivants from one hunting trip to the next, heedless of either the rot infesting his bureaucrats or the insurgency barely tampered by the scores of mercenaries he employs. In addition, the man has no qualms handing Zentralafrika's bounty, rightwise the Reich's, to its supposed enemies for the right price. Americans, Japanese, the Free French - as long as they're buying, he's selling.\n\nDespite its myriad defects, Zentralafrika's facade holds strong. The only man of any importance to pierce through it is fellow Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig; between his words and Müller's, there's no question as to whose the Reich will heed most. For now, Müller's rule is secure, and he is free to hum his safari tune while his colony burns."

 ANG_Cashmoney:0 "아프리카의 비행장"
 ANG_Cashmoney_desc:0 "Although Südwestafrika's economy is the most lacking of the three African Reichskommissariats, mainly due to Reichskommissar Schenck's disinterest in further developing it, Südwestafrika is not without its sources of income. Thanks to its location and administration, Südwestafrika has become an important staging ground for Luftwaffe airplanes sent on missions across the entire continent, be they bombing training on African civilians or simply patrols meant to intimidate South Africa.\n\nOur position as the masters of the Afrikaner Luftwaffe grants us a large freedom of action, and the possibility to obtain funds through simplified channels compared to the other Reichskommissariaten. Of course, we can use this to our advantage and for the good of Angola, subtracting both money and resources for the development of the region.\n\nHowever, everything comes at a price. The Reich is starving, and the grip on the colonies will tighten more and more as they try to squeeze us dry to fuel their dying economy. As such, our "creative accounting techniques" must be used with great caution: the more inconsistencies are found within our numbers, the more likely we are to be put under serious scrutiny. And we all know what the consequences of our plans being discovered will be...\n\nCurrently, we have §Y[?ANG_Liquid_Cash] million USD§! in investment funds.\n\nCurrently, we will have to send§Y [?ANG_German_Collection] million USD§! to Germany each collection period.\n\nAs of right now, Germany is currently [GetANGGermanDispleasure] displeased with us"

ANG_Pre_SAW_Fucking_Germany:0 "We are not currently doing anything with our operation"


ANG_Prioritized_Runways:0 "By giving priority to Müller's cargo, mostly lucrative goods produced by the corporations supporting him, he'll give us our share of the pie, which will help us greatly with our economic plans.\nOf course, the fact that we are ignoring the Vaterland's requests to take their supplies and bombs in our planes will have consequences, so we should expect a backlash in some form."
ANG_Redirect_Traffic_tt:0 "By allowing priority landing to luxury flights, or to the private airplanes of the wealthy few who can pay the additional "priority fee" to our administration, we'll increase our income by a nice amount.\nIs this a racket? Perhaps. Will the Reich be angry? Most likely. Will this bring us lots and lots of money? Sure as hell!"
ANG_Increase_Transportation_Capability_Tooltip:0 "The central government expects our runways to always be ready to accept their supply and military flights. Müller has offered to pay us handsomely if we ship his resources with our planes. Surely we can find an accomodation..."
ANG_Skimming_A_Little_Fuel_tt:0 "We can subtract a part of the fuel from the supply cargos and sell it to the private market for a nice revenue. Of course, sooner or later the government in Germania will notice the inconsistency in the numbers, but by then we'll probably be wealthy enough to cover our tracks... or at least we hope so."
ANG_Skimming_A_Lot_Of_Fuel_tt:0 "To cover our increased need for money, we can sell even more fuel from our official supplies. This will surely alert the mainland Reich, and we can surely expect a reaction, perhaps even an inspection. Still, we need more funds, which means this might be a forced choice."
ANG_Selling_Gold_Diamonds:0 "To cover our increased need for money, we can sell even more fuel from our official supplies.

ANG_Market_Build_Roads_tt:0 "As with all Reichskommissariaten, the state of our infrastructure network is, with the sole exceptions of air transport, extremely poor. By attracting investors from the Vaterland, we can convince them to fund new roads and railroads all throughout Südwestafrika\n\n"

For the glory of the Vaterland, of course!\n\n"
ANG_Market_Build_bombs:0 "Our military industry can hardly keep up with the demands of both our garrison and the Afrikaner Luftwaffe. If we want to ensure we can supply our forces to the fullest, we need to convince the Reich to open up new production plants in our lands, or we'll risk total collapse should we be cut off from the supplies sent by the mainland.\n\n"

ANG_German_Sus_idea_2_desc:0 "The Reich is slightly displeased with us of late. Delays in fulfilling requests and inconsistencies in our reports have begun piling up. While it is well known that our Reichskommissar governs with a light touch, a few in Germania are beginning to wonder..."

ANG_German_Sus_idea_3:0 "독일의 불만"
ANG_German_Sus_idea_3_desc:0 "The Reich has grown displeased with us.

ANG_German_Sus_idea_5:0 "독일의 불만 매우 높음"
ANG_German_Sus_idea_4_desc:0 "The Reich is very highly displeased with us. News from Germania have gone quiet as the last few bureaucrats skeptical of our wrongdoings have given up defending us. If this level of suspicion does not change, the Reichskomissar is in great danger."

 ANG_Slipping_The_Plans_desc:0 "Our worst fears have been confirmed: the OFN have somehow managed to crack our codes and can now read our moves with as much accuracy as we do ourselves. We had our suspicions aroused when they began to intercept our flights with a growing regularity, but we had brushed it off as simply bad luck. There is no denying it now however and if only it were as easy to fix as changing the codes, even daily if we had to, but we have tried to no avail. We have no idea how they are managing to penetrate our deepest secrets so easily, and Reichskommissar Schenck seems to be convinced a mole is operating within the air control service and has vowed to flush them out, whoever they may be."

While we keep as much suspicion of our backs and offer excuses of partisan sabotage and native uproar we will be hard at work preparing the future Angolan state that will take our place on this continent and the weight from our souls.

 ANG_Lords_Of_The_Air_desc:0 "While the other RKs may have us beat in terms of land forces, there is a reason we have become one of the linchpins of our combined strategy. It is this: while Hüttig spent his time butchering natives and Müller hunted the beasts of the plains, we have been producing the greatest planes and pilots in all the world. Our bombers can ravage formations and raze cities while our fighters can cut the prime of the west's airfleets to the grain. We can ferry our troops anywhere across the front in only a few hours time, we are the cavalry of the modern age, the knights of the sky. The Amerikanische know it, the other RKs know it, and we know it: we are the lords of the air!"
 ANG_Lords_Of_The_Air_2:0 "Gods of the Sky"
 ANG_Lords_Of_The_Air_2_desc:0 "Trails of fire punctuate the skies above South Africa day in and day out. They are the OFN's answer to our skill and cunning, and yet look at how they fall to Earth! They are Icarus, flying too close to the sun in a vain attempt to match our prowess and power, and they have had their wings clipped as punishment for their hubris. We wonder how they can keep sending more young men to their deaths, knowing as they must the futility of their situation, and yet they do not stop. In the heart of every knight of the sky is the fear of that horrible descent back down below the clouds of freedom and to the dirt of reality. To the dogs of the west, we have become the harbingers of that fate."
 ANG_Joint_Offensive_Shit:0 "Coordinated Attacks"
 ANG_Joint_Offensive_Shit_desc:0 "The only way for our war to succeed is if we come up with a well crafted strategy for working together with our fellow RKs. That may be almost as difficult as actually fighting the South Africans but if we fail to coordinate, we will leave ourselves vulnerable to be picked off one by one. We control the air fleets of Africa, so we shall provide air support while Müller supplies us with resources and Hüttig deploys his veteran killers. Together we will work as a single body to crush the dogs of the US."

 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_1:0 "Centralized Air Control"
 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_1_desc:0 "With our near full monopoly over Luftwaffe aircraft and resources in Afrika, we may rest assured that all airborne operations shall proceed as we intend them to. Whilst this may be upsetting for our partners in the Schild, this will prevent any incidents due to conflicting orders from the three Reichskommissariats, allowing flight operations to be undertaken smoothly and with great effect."
 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_2:0 "Efficient Air Control"
 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_2_desc:0 "With a great fleet of aircraft comes a great need for skilled personnel to pilot them. Whilst allowing any layman with minimal training to take to the skies might be adequate for some, our aircraft shall only be piloted by the best and brightest. As such, all of our existing aviators, as well as any prospective new blood, are put through a rigorous and long training process.\n\nForced to develop and prove both their physical strength and mental prowess, once they emerge from the training program, our pilots will be ready to face any foe. Many do not make it through this process, but it is a small price to pay for a new generation of ace pilots."
 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_3:0 "Improved Air Control"
 ANG_PlanesInOurHand_3_desc:0 "Day by day, our best and brightest take to the skies in a campaign of conquest. The conquest of the air. Our pilots, their skills and abilities honed by a rigorous training program that only an elite few manage to graduate, have become a terror to all. These men have been put to good use in our Luftwaffe operations, displaying their prowess at the controls of an aircraft. Foreign pilots surely tremble at the thought of picking a fight with a Südwestafrikan aviator!"
 ANG_RANDR:0 "Rest and Rehabilitation"
 ANG_RANDR_desc:0 "In the Second World War, Schenck saw first hand the dangers of pushing soldiers harder than a human being can handle physically and mentally. Burn out, PTSD, even suicide. In other words, a recipe for a total disaster. Being a soldier is stressful enough as it is but asking a man to go into the sky day after day against increasing odds with little chance of survival if shot down? These brave men deserve a little R and R every now and then if only for the practical reason of not having sleep deprived men at the controls of the most expensive pieces of equipment in production."

 ANG_RANDR_2:0 "Veteran-Led Training"
 ANG_RANDR_2_desc:0 "Most of our pilots are still fairly green, after all, they've never fired a shot in actual combat not counting mock-ups and simulations that can never truly prepare a pan for real battle. Sending them into the meat grinder as they are now will only lose us manpower and planes at unacceptable rates. Having a good deal of real life experience himself, Schenck has proposed a crash-course veteran's led training regime for the pilots we'll be deploying so they hopefully don't all get shot down within the first minutes of battle."

 ANG_Natives_In_The_Air_1:0 "Integrated Native Support"
 ANG_Natives_In_The_Air_1_desc:0 "Schenck is not too proud to admit that the current war in the south will not be won by Aryan might alone. Whatever Hüttig might wish to pretend, we will eventually run out of German-born pilots and if we continue to adhere to such delusions we will soon find ourselves at the mercy of OFN bombers. We may not have a large reserve of our own pilots, but we do have quite a large population of natives that could be better put to use as pilots than slaves or worse yet, completely unutilized. A program to train the best and brightest of the natives in the art of flight could prove to be the line between victory and failure."

 ANG_Natives_In_The_Air_2:0 "Native Squadrons"
 ANG_Natives_In_The_Air_2_desc:0 "Reports from the air wings we embedded our first native pilot recruits are returning and so far the results are impressive. The natives are not yet the equals of our extensively trained and prepared pilots but given time we could see several native aces. Reichskommisar Schenck agrees with this assessment and had even ordered half a dozen all-native air squadrons to be raised at once. Rumblings have been heard from hardliners in Quelimane but results are results and we don't have the luxury of purity at a time like this."

 ANG_Mutual_Assistence_Pact:0 "The Mutual Assistance Agreement"
ANG_Mutual_Assistance_Pact_desc:0 "The Airport of Afrika was never built to handle a land war, and beyond that, with our connection to the Vaterland cut we are going to run out of supplies and fuel sooner rather than later. That is, unless we actually cooperate with our fellow Reichskommisarriats. How helpful they'll end up being is questionable; after all, Hüttig seems to hate us with a passion and Müller... well, we have no indication that Müller will necessarily care anymore about this life or death struggle than he ever did about running his colony. Still, if we can actually get them to take the pressure off of our land forces we can better fight the air war. Everyone will win."

So if Schenck needs our boys to secure his borders so they can focus on their flying shit and Hüttig needs more resources to kill children or whatever it is he does for fun then they'll get what they want. Of course, any trade comes with give and takes, and we had damn well better start seeing transports and anti-partisan units on our bases soon."

 ANG_Mutual_Assistance_Pact_MZB_desc:0 "It pains to admit, but for the moment at least, we need those degenerate failures in the other RKs to give us support if we wish to see the race traitors of the OFN sent to Hell. Naturally, we do this only out of pure practicality. The idea of collaborating with Müller, the incompetent bastard, or bleeding-heart Schenck is almost enough to make us nasueous but we all have to make sacrifices in a crisis. With a little luck and a few million liters of spilt American and South African blood we can end this farce quickly and then... well, then we won't need the dead weight any longer."

Still, crying over the facts will get us nothing, and where nature has failed to provide an easy route to the front for our northern brothers, technology will find a way. We have set up a deal with Müller that will see a veritable air highway of transport planes and helicopters ferrying Zentralafrikaner divisions to our airports where they can march into combat as fresh as when they began their journey down."

The air fleet of RK Südwestafrika may be the most impressive in all of the continent, but now that the OFN has begun to deploy their squadrons by the dozens a massive air build up will be required to match the Amerikaner Air Force in the skies above South Africa."

 ANG_Using_Our_People_desc:0 "Tired of the unending transgressions of Hüttig's SS cronies, Reichskommissar Schenck has refused to take the aid of the Ostafrikan SS any further. However, a Reichskommissariat would be nothing without it's army, and Schenck has acknowledged this. As a result, Südwestafrika has undertaken a program of native conscription to fill the gaps left by the refusal of the SS. For nearly no pay, some local men and boys are ordered into service for the Südwestafrikan Kolonialgarnison. Whilst we can expect little out of these men other than what they are forced to do, they can hold rifles, they can shoot towards the enemy, and they can fill vacancies in our ranks."

As a result, fit and willing men from across the Reichskommissariat abandon their meager lives for a promise of better pay in the Kolonialgarnisons. Not only are the numbers of willing and able men impressive, but these men are willing to fight well and hard to earn their keep. Their loyalties are secure."
 ANG_Using_Our_People_Paid_Enough:0 "Compensated Native Squadrons"
 ANG_Using_Our_People_Paid_Enough_desc:0 "Whilst the native Kolonialgarnisonnen are technically paid for their service, it is little more than a pittance. The only ones who appear to be enticed by such small payments are destitute farmers and peasants who have few other options to feed themselves and survive the next month. Whilst this pay may bring in more bodies to hold rifles, it is merely enough to ensure the men do their jobs without question. Little more can be expected of such recruits."

 ANG_Using_Our_People_Paid_Well_2_desc:0 "Reichskommisar Schenck has expanded his native Kolonialgarnison program to include a near luxurious pay cheque for those who are involved. It is so enticing, in fact, that men from across Südwestafrika drop their tools of labour to flock towards the recruitment offices. In exchange for grand payments for their service, the native squadrons go above and beyond in their duties for the Reichskommissariat. If one were to look only upon their deeds, they could easily be mistaken for the German soldiery. Perhaps men and their happiness can be bought."
 ANG_Using_Our_People_Paid_Enough_2:0 "Compensated Native Squadrons"
 ANG_Using_Our_People_Paid_Enough_2_desc:0 "Whilst the native Kolonialgarnisonnen are technically paid for their service, it is very meager. A salary this small seems to only appeal to young boys who have not known better pay, or men who have fallen upon hard times. Regardless of the kinds of men attracted by such meager pay, the increase in performance has been noticeable. Although it inspires few acts of valour, it would appear that the prospect of going home with a pocket full of marks is an exciting one to some, and they're much more willing to fight and serve to earn it."

 ANG_SS_Anti_Terror_desc:0 "As a show of good-will between our two Reichskomissariaten, Hüttig has sent several SS brigades he assured us were "experts" in counter-guerilla and terror operations. He was not lying; these SS men are good and what they do, perhaps too good in fact. Reports from our own counter-insurgency teams report entire villages have been razed to the ground and even evidence of mass graves close to some of these ruins. While some in our administration have voiced concerns that such actions may damage long-term stability, we have observed a noticeable decrease in raids on our forces. These measures may be difficult to stomach but war demands sacrifices."

 ANG_SS_Anti_Terror_2:0 "Trained SS Squadrons"
 ANG_SS_Anti_Terror_2_desc:0 "Given the SS operations teams have had in dampening  native resistance so far, Schenck has felt compelled to request further support from Hüttig. Despite the personal disagreements the two have had, it seems that Hüttig genuinely enjoys stomping out native movements wherever he can find them, even if he has to work with men he personally despises. The latest SS troops he has deployed within Südwestafrika are highly competent butchers, many of whom have significant experience from service in Ostland and Moscowien. While any help is appreciated, some are beginning to wonder if the price is worth it as we have been seeing a leap in reported actions against civilian population centers, including against groups that were not even suspected of participating in reprisals. Native representatives are outraged and more than one of Schenck's aides have blanched when shown photos of what the SS has done to two prominent native communities in the north of the RK."

Native reprisals, far more coordinated than anything we had ever seen from them before, are occurring almost daily now. It seems that we could only keep them checked via fear for so long, but now that our attention is fixed firmly south, they have chosen their moment to strike like snakes in the grass. If we are unable to resolve this situation we risk having our attention dangerously divided."

At this rate, it'll only be a matter of time before even the dimmest of their commanders realize how vulnerable we really are. Of course, we don't have to be as weak as they'll be expecting. While we will still be pumping out new aircraft as fast as they can be assembled we will also put substantial resources into establishing fixed anti-aircraft flakturmen that can tear bomber flights to shreds within minutes."

While we and our fellow RKs have mobilized to their aid, the fact remains that these brave warriors are easy pickings for the western air fleets. We have begun to ship out planes from our surplus to the air bases under Boer control in the hope that they can make more effective use of them than we currently can.

ANG_prewar.1.desc:0 "The skies of Windhoek are one of the few places in the world where the amount of artificial birds surpass the natural ones, but one of them outshines all others for his desire to simply change, to exchange his metallic wings for real ones. Oh, how good it would feel to simply forget, to live freely amidst the clouds! Today, like any other day, Wolfgang Schenck flies over the capital of his colonial domain, looking to escape from the cage he himself built around his soul.\n\nA veteran ace, Schenck's experience with aircrafts is such that he doesn't even need to look at the commands anymore. Sadly, however, there are so many other things he needs to be careful about: monsters lurk around him during the day, and even worse ones await him in his own mind, to ambush him as soon as he closes his eyes. Suddenly, a loud noise wrenches him from his thoughts and dreams, throwing him back to reality. No, this isn't reality. It can't be!\n\n"Enemy fighters inbound, prepare for interception! Escort the bombers to their target, ensure they hit the enemy production plants!"\n"No, no, no! They aren't factories, they are civilian houses! Schenck to command, the target has no strategic value! Abort mission! Command, answer! Command! COMMAND!"\n\nWolfgang's own screams awake him from his delirium, and his mind slowly sputters back to life. One by one, he detaches his fingers from the cloche they are locked around, and redirects his plane to the airstrip, the noise finally reminding him of his own humanity: without fuel, his fake wings won't take him away. As he gets out from the cockpit, he is immediately assailed by the monsters he tries so hard to repel: advisors, bureaucrats, everyone wants him to do his duty. Duty. DUTY. The mere word makes him sick, so he nods when he needs to not, signs what he needs to sign, until the responsible for Native Housing brings him the latest report on the building projects. Already thousands of natives are living in actual houses, and more will soon be built, but this small sunshine is soon blotted by the clouds telling him that there aren't enough funds to proceed with the plan, so he leaves the official and returns to his refuelled plane, taking off once more from the Earth, alone and too ashamed to look down."

Still, this one is closer to his compound, which means less time to travel to and from it, and more time to be spent flying high, far from all this. Any feelings of relief possibly coming from this thought are choked into their cradle by the realization that all construction crews members are natives, and that most of them are carrying weights far heavier than what should be allowed.\n\nFor once, the usual bureaucrat asking for his attention is welcomed as he allows him not to think about the suffering of the people of this god-forsaken land. "Reichskommissar, what should we bring into the new hangars first?"\n"We require mostly foodstuff and medicines against malaria, but I'll have my orders sent later."\n"I'm deeply sorry Reichskommissar, but I was talking about whether we would store the fuel for the bombers or the one for the fighters. The silos can't hold food or medicines."\n\nThe condescending look on the official's face feels like a slap, and the notion that he had almost slipped his plans to the ones who could send him to a concentration camp makes his guts churn so much he feels about to vomit.\n"S-sorry, I wa-was thinking about what measures we should take in the case of a pandemic, Sekretar Bohlm sent me an overview of our situation this morning. We should house our new bombers in this airstrip, so their fuel will take precedence."\nHis excuse sounds pathetic even to his own ears, but the bureaucrat seems to believe it, or at least he doesn't let his doubts show.

Despite all efforts from Wolfgang's team of professional "book-adapters", there simply was nothing to begin with, and therefore they couldn't make it look like everything was perfect.\n\nWith trembling hands, he forces his own eyes to keep reading words and numbers that feel like bullets piercing his naked body, a carnage of arithmetics leaving no space to doubts or "creative" interpretation, and thinks about the potential consequences of his miscalculations. Of course, he just had to squander all that money in the early stages of the project, a fucking genius!\n\nNow they'll be furious in Germania. Investors will think twice before spending their money in Südwestafrika, and the central government will surely start pestering him, they'll want to know where the hell has all the money they sent him gone! How can he answer that question? There's no time to waste! Cut here and there, a few zeroes in the right places, be fucking creative! With enough paint job, all will appear to be perfect, won't it?\n\nThe worst isn't that, however. The Reich will start being suspicious, for real this time. They will no longer accept our books without bothering to check whether our expenses are justified: the Ministry will count each and every Reichsmark now, and double-check the papers before granting us our funds. The bastards will send inspectors, maybe even spies!\n\nResisting the urge to rip the papers to shreds and scream, Schenck now realizes he needs to be careful, so much more than ever before: now, he is walking on a thin thread above the bottomless abyss of damnation, and the tiniest mistake will ruin everything."

Valdemar Lourenço had gotten used to seeing the bombers take off from the airstrip, and he was glad that he was there, tending to their frames, rather than wherever they went to practice their "peerless skill" at turning the Earth into hell. His job was easy, but it had taken time for him to learn: even the easiest mechanical concepts had seemed arcane wizardry to a young analphabet Angolan, but somehow, instead of ending up in the slave mines, he had been sent to work and learn a job at the repairing station. Even more strangely, he wasn't the only one there: the entire crew was comprised of natives, a notion akin to sacrilege in Ostafrika.\n\nWithout planes to tend to, he was busy doing the only thing that was left to do, which meant looking at the shadows cast by the control tower, watching it grow shorter during the morning, and longer during the afternoon. Suddenly, a noise alerted him, and sure enough a bomber landed, his cargo emptied on whatever soul unfortunate enough to stand out in the hole-riddled inferno that was Southern Sahara. Its pilot came out looking tired, and as soon as he set his eyes on Valdemar and his colleagues he started barking orders.\n\n"What in hell are you doing there?! Stop loitering and refuel my fucking plane!" and immediately the crew starts tending to the towering aircraft. As they set diligently, if a bit begrudgingly, to their work, the German kept grumbling: "Why did that softie allow such things? Letting Untermensch do an Aryan's job, what did Schenck think? It's a miracle our planes aren't falling apart... If only we had a stronger Reichskommissar, one like Hüttig, there would be no disorder in this godforsaken land!"\n\nValdemar listened and, though those words stung like a hundred tiny needles in his soul, he ultimately did nothing. If the insults were the price for being able to live outside of the camps, and feed his family, it was far too cheap: he finished refitting the plane, and looked away as the replacement pilot came and the large bomber took off once again to whatever its destination was."

His ceremonial garbs are perfect, and he has made sure to pin all of his medals to his chest, even though a certain one feels as if it had stabbed his own heart, a dead man hanging from his uniform and exposing his filth for everyone to see. He isn't used to luxury and fine dinners, and never will be, partially because he was a soldier at heart, but mostly because denying himself any pleasure, be it physical or mental, makes him feel as if he's atoning a bit for his crimes.\n\nShaking his head to free it from the dreadful thoughts prying his psyche even when awake, he smiles at the businessman whose blatant attempts at bribery he is currently trying to ignore, assuring him that the new industrial development of Südwestafrika is just the beginning, and more investments would surely return the initial capital tenfold. "You are doing the right thing by investing in the Reichskommissariat," he says sincerely to the corporate suit, though the true meaning of his words is completely different: if only he knew what the "right thing" Schenck intended to do with all those Reichsmarks truly was, he wouldn't be so eager to drown him in money...\n\nStill, even though uncomfortable, Schenck is grateful for the invitation to this social dinner at Windhoek's best (and only) high-class restaurant, and for what it means. Through his efforts, now Angola possesses a sizeable industrial base - compared to the African average at least - and this has brought not only more prosperity for the people, who are employed in the new factories as regular, if still underpaid, workers rather than slaves, but has also attracted even more investors willing to pay for a part in what many in Germania have dubbed "Afrika's diamond in the rough".\n\nTaking a canapè from the tray the server almost shoves into his face, he can't help thinking that - just for this once - he might deserve a small reward for his efforts."

For years, he had been used to refuelling planes by bringing dozens of heavy jerry cans from the gas pipe to the aircraft, and back again: a back-breaking experience, and even if he had gotten used by now, it was still a damn tiring thing to do every day, several times a day. Now, however, he was looking at the future.\n\nUnder his eyes was a rubber tube several dozen meters long, attached to a sputtering engine, itself connected to the fuel pipe. When the instructor pressed a button, the entire crew almost jumped as the tube inflated and started moving like an uncontrolled snake, until gas erupted from the nozzle. With a small chuckle, the officer told them - strangely, he was neither screaming nor insulting them at every sentence, which was a welcomed change in itself - that it was a refuelling pump: gone were the times of jerrycans, now all they needed to do was to connect the hose to the plane's fuel tank and the machine would pump gas all the way to it, filling it in record time and without any broken vertebrae.\n\nThe German went on about how to correctly maintain the complex machine, what spare parts to use and how to put them in place, but the young Angolan only listened to it partially. In his head, many thoughts were swirling: why was their work suddenly considered important? Why had their salaries been increased? Why was this German so kind to them? He was still regularly insulted and bullied by other German pilots and officers, but why was this one different?\n\nIn the end, Valdemar decided not to worry. He was too small to be part of the great game, and he knew too little to truly understand what was happening, so the best thing to do was to enjoy this new normality, and make the most out of it. When the German asked if everything was clear, the young man nodded vigorously, smiling at the officer, who returned the smile. Perhaps things were really going to change, after all."

ANG_prewar.7.desc:0 "When the first drillings had begun, most had considered it another of Schenck's pet projects. His desire to improve the conditions of the Angolan populace had been noticed by the higher echelons of the Ministry for Colonial Affairs, but Südwestafrika had always been fulfilling its duties towards the greater Reich, so they had left him free to do what he wanted: after all, a few thousands slaves "liberated" don't change the larger picture...\n\nToday, however, they must probably be rethinking their beliefs, as the first reports of what has been dubbed "the Angolan oil rush" are on their desks, as well as Schenck's. The expressions are completely different, however: the bureaucrats in Germania are most likely bewildered by the amount of zeros in the "gains" part of the report, while Schenck looks at the documents with a rare look of satisfaction. This has been his biggest bet, after all; by making Angola self-sufficient in oil production, he can not only supply his beloved planes, but also kickstart power production plants bringing electricity to the region's main settlement.\n\nQuality of life hasn't been the only improvement, however. By ensuring an efficient supply of electrical energy, the power outages plaguing factories and military production plants have all but disappeared, considerably boosting production rates, and native discontent is decreasing as they get access to services such as heating and road illumination. Investors are flocking to Südwestafrika to get a share of the oil pie, and Wolfgang is more than happy to let them do this. Everyone is welcome to join him in making Angola a better place to live! "If only they knew they won't get a single Reichsmark back" he thinks, letting out a chuckle that surprises him. When has it been the last time he'd had anything resembling a sincere laugh?

All trees had been cut, and machinery the likes of which he had never seen had flattened the terrain and dug the foundations for what was to come. Day after day, columns had sprung like armored concrete trees from the ground, and even bigger machines had been assembled inside. Now, smoke billowed from tall chimney stacks, and trucks filled the now-pristine road as they brought materials to and from the immense production plants.\n\nThe results of this industrial development had been felt by everyone, even the locals. Valdemar could now buy more food with his salary as prices had dropped, and he had even been able to afford a wristwatch! Yes, it was a cheap trinket, and the actual time-keeper was so small it was barely-visible, but it was still the real thing.\n\nAs the bus went past the new industrial quarter, his eyes looked at the most bewildering thing in this entire affair: the trees from the forest had been turned into small but practical houses for the homeless Angolans. This only he truly couldn't understand. The timber had a high value, so why waste it for people such as he? Weren't they considered unworthy of anything more than slavery? Why was this man, this "Schenck" everyone talked about, so interested in their well-being? The young Angolan knew there was something more to it, something hidden, but in the end, he most probably would never know it. The best he could do was enjoying the fruits of this strange thing he had never known: prosperity."

Dressed sharply in their parade attire, the column of graduates marched past the commanding officer of training, and past the small crowd that had gathered to witness the monthly event.\n\nDespite all the graduates being in identical uniforms, Valdermar knew he stuck out amidst the others, as he could feel the crowd stare in disbelief at the black man marching in a Luftwaffe parade.\n\nThe parade came to a halt, as the commanding officer made his way along the line of graduates. One by one pinning the silver eagles upon their right breast. The Oberstleutnant paused when he arrived at Valdemar, hesitantly staring down his graduate, before finally pinning the eagle upon his chest.\n\nUpon most other days, Valdemar would have been bothered, and perhaps discouraged, to receive such peculiar attention.

The learned observer wouldn't miss the striking resemblance to the villas so common in the Southern states of the USA, and the owners would proudly agree: after all, great minds do think alike. The only difference is what lies outside of the large garden: instead of large cotton fields, just behind the villa is a mine, a large hole in the ground where minerals are constantly extracted and brought to the surface, ready to be sent to either Windhoek or Leopoldville. The only common theme is the hundreds of slaves toiling to their death under the sun: this, surely, would never change.\n\nLike ancient Romans attending a gladiatorial game at the Coliseum, the German owners are having lunch in the garden, directly overlooking the mine. As the servers bring the meals, one of the mine slaves trips, spilling the minerals he has collected. Immediately, one of the guards is at his side, giving him a well-placed kick in the kidney which makes him jerk on the floor, followed by a well-deserved whipping that lasts until the wretch has collected everything: with blood dripping from his back and his arms, the inferior resumes his duty.\n\n"Gunther, my dear, did you see that? Truly a shame..." says a middle-aged woman.\n"Yes Margarethe, this is a disgrace," echoes a man, likely her husband: "such laziness and lack of skill is unbecoming of our workforce, and accidents like this are increasing, despite the commendable efforts of our employees"\n"This must be Schenck's fault," continues the respectable lady, "ever since he started with his pet projects, the slaves have been restless: the number of escapes has tripled, and some have been found asking for better conditions!"\n"I know, my love.

A single machine pierced the hardest stone in seconds, and a new electric cart system allowed the ore to be quickly - and painlessly - carried outside.\n\nAt first, the director had complained, even more so considered the need to retrain the natives in "things better left to Aryans" and to increase their salaries when all they deserved was "a whipping to remind them of their position in the Aryan society" but then he had seen the reports: his eyes had almost popped out of his skull when the weekly report showed a clearly wrong amount of zeros in the "extracted tonnes" category, and all complains had ceased with the same speed they had begun, especially after a curt phone call from the majority shareholder telling him to "shut his trap and let the money flow"\n\nThe natives of Benguela largely ignored such great games, but they felt their effects. Death rates went down to one-cipher numbers, and their lives improved, so much that commodities like canned food, bikes and even medicines became affordable by common workers. The streets of Benguela, just as those around most of Angola and Namibia, slowly filled people doing their business just as their mines filled with the noises made by jackhammers, trucks and trains: perhaps, things are truly going to be better."

The lives of the people there are simple but peaceful, a never ending cycle of small things. That is, until the Man in Black came.\n\nThe first time they saw the bird landing on the small clearing outside their village, everyone escaped, fearing monsters or demons, but after seeing him, the village elder wisely noted that "this man is no demon: the true ones are circling around him, invisible to our human eyes" before ushering everyone to their huts. Ever since then, the man's visits have been regular, once every couple moons or so, and the people no longer worry when they see him coming near the village: after all, he never enters, he always stays near the trees. Crying. That's all he does. He cries, he bawls, he screams: guttural words the people of the village can't understand, but the pain in them requires no interpreter.\n\nThis day is one such day, but something is different. The Man in Black looks even sadder, and suddenly starts banging his head against a tree. However, a small child breaks free from his mother's embrace, running to him as the woman looks in horror, too terrified to move. The baby tugs on the man's trousers, and the stranger stops his self-harming to look at him, blood dripping from his scratched forehead. As he sees the big, soulful eyes, even more tears come from his reddened eyes, but his trembling hand goes briefly to his pocket, and then he runs away again. When the child returns, he has something in his hands: a small metal box with images of fruits, some known, others not, containing small balls, and before his mother can stop him, he puts one of them inside his mouth.

ANG_prewar.16.desc:0 ""Wolfgang! How the fuck are you?"\n\nReichskommissar Schenck moaned. He grumbled, "Hello, Müller. I'm busy working, and need to attend to that at the moment. I'm terribly sorry, but if you could-"\n\n"Come on, Wolfgang, you're never busy!" laughed Müller. "Unless you have to fly your aircraft again. Maybe next time you could modify it to be a two-seater, so we can go flying together. You can pilot, while I aim my rifle at the game on the ground."\n\n"It's really serious, Müller, so if you contact my secretary, that would-"\n\n"Yes, and I could tell her to make some copies, get me a stiff drink, and blow me." Both knew Schenck's secretary was not a woman; Müller had just talked to him. "But anyway, how's the bombing campaign going? Are the Free French gone yet? Jacques says your boys can't hit the side of a barn even if they tried to crash into it. You sure they're killing enough natives?"\n\nSchenck had no time for this. "Müller, I'm busy, just tell me what you want, and fucking leave me alone!"\n\n"Alright then. Twenty bombers for transporting my men. My guys will be in Malanje to pick them up. We'll tell the pilots where to go. Just send me the bill."\n\n"Wait, what-"\n\n"Thank you for your cooperation, Wolfgang. Heil Hitler." And Müller hung up."

ANG_prewar.17.desc:0 "Schenck knew what his major flaw was. It started during Russia, he figured, but he only really noticed it after he was transferred out as a hero. The parades, medals, and accolades would feed the ego of any normal person, but Schenck would try to slink away from it, or any other responsibility. In Africa, he recognized it for what it was. His drifting off during meetings, his early nights and late mornings, the constant escapes to the solitude of his fighter, all were part of a subconscious attempt to isolate himself from the world. And so long as his Luftwaffe stayed away from civilian targets, he felt numb to anything else going on around him.\n\nSo why did that request from Müller bother him?\n\nMüller was a prick, without a doubt. One that knew Schenck's vulnerabilities and sore spots, and how to poke them. He cared as much about what went on in the outside world as Schenck did, and was breaking as many rules as Schenck was. But the difference was Müller relished in what he did and what he was doing, while Schenck tried to hide away from it and minimize the pain and suffering he inflicted as much as possible. And that was why Schenck despised him, he decided. Müller had done practically everything Schenck did and instead of trying to hide or make a small amount of amends, he would continue to be a bastard and relish every moment of it.\n\nAnd Schenck realized that the bill for the bombers Müller borrowed had yet to go out.\n\nHe found it on his desk and added a couple zeroes to the bottom line. Now they were even, and the cocoon closed once more."

And then I started hearing the natives fire a G1 from over in the bush, and my lieutenant looked like he pissed himself!"\n\nThe group laughed, as the door to the office opened. A servant slipped in, and gestured to a piece of paper he was holding. Müller noticed, and motioned for it to be left on the coffee table.\n\n"So how the fuck did these villagers get their hands on a G1?" he asked as the servant left, closing the door behind him. "There isn't a mauser plant on the Südwestafrikan border! Hell, I couldn't even get my hands on them when they came out," he said as he checked the document. "Mostly because Jacques made it worth more if they went to-"\n\nSomething was up, everyone else could tell. Müller read the document once more. Then again.\n\n"That fucker Schenck!" he yelled, flying into a rage. "Does he think I'm stupid? That my men traveled first class on his shitty bombers and ordered steak and lobster on the flight? That he installed fancy fucking seats with ashtrays and brought blonde stewardesses with D-cups straight from Bavaria? The piece of shit thinks he can fuck me dry, and take a whole gold mine because he flem my men from one place to another? I ought to fly down to Windhoek and pop him from my helicopter when he takes the paper off his porch-"\n\nHe then became mindful once again of the audience. "Excuse me," he said as he left for his office, "I need to make a fucking phone call.""

"Your fucking bill came in, and you seem to be under the impression I can just be bled like a stuck pig. You want to charge how fucking much for the bombers? You're not going to get that, because I don't know how you can spend that much for a few flights! Do you burn the reichsmarks for your jet engines? Are your tires made out of white gold? What the fuck is it, you greedy piece of shit?"\n\nSchenck had been preparing for this moment since he approved the bill. "Reichskommisar Müller, the planes were returned in a dilapidated state. My ground crews found them covered in trash and mud. Removing the dirt and urine out of them took ages, and they still smell. And there's still one missing that my pilots say you blew up. So, yes, I did add those expenses to the bill, on top of the regular fuel and maintenance that would be necessary for the flight under normal circumstances. So are you going to accept the reason why and pay me? Or am I spending our fatherland's money and telling them exactly why I spent their funds when they start asking?"\n\nSilence on both ends. A hard decision was about to be made.\n\nMüller laughed. "Alright, Wolfgang, I got you. Just wanted to be sure you weren't trying to fuck me on this. Have fun cleaning out the piss. Heil Hitler," said a man trying his best to pretend he hadn't just been cornered and defeated and was actually fine with the situation. He hung up after that."

His suspicions had turned into fear when the phone had gone unanswered, one, then two, then three times, and then an entire two days passed with no answer. had passed with no answer, no matter how many times he called; desperate to be heard, to be answered, to know something, ANYTHING, he had sent a desperate plea to his former comrades in the Luftwaffe, hoping to reach at least one of them. Finally, the phone connects, and a tired voice tells him all he wanted to know: with every word, his face becomes paler, and at the end, he finally feels how Oedipus felt when he learned all about his origins.\n\n"Ludwig, you must be-"\n"Wolfgang, for the love of God, don't return home! Stay there and pray that this... madness doesn't spill into the colonies. We are-" a loud sound, an explosion, fills the line, then the voice returns "Wolfgang, they have arrived! It isn't safe an-" and then the line dies.\n\nHis hands start to tremble, and cold sweat runs down his spine. He can't deny the truth any longer: the Reich has collapsed into civil war.

###### Events
ANG.1.t:0 "The Eternal Question"
ANG.1.desc:0 "Never easy to sleep in the African heat, even with winter approaching. Schenk's eyes tracked the fan, lazily cycling in the dusky room. Moonlight casting deep shadows from the window. The Reichskomissar thought of flying under the stars, their light unmarred by clouds. He did not deserve clear skies, only shadows. All the better to hide in, a coward, a traitor with false heart and no convictions.\n\nWar in Germany. Crows fighting for the corpse of the fatherland. War in Africa. A pointless struggle to maintain a pointless system. Failing colonies defended by a shield of SS fanatics and corrupt mercenaries. And by Reischkomissar Schenk, the most despicable of them all.\n\nThe pilot had flown so much, trying to leave on the ground his sorrow, his shame. Lost in the sky, he could daydream by himself. Helping the natives. Giving them the means of overthrowing the German system. The logistics of it were dead simple. None audited Südwestafrica, especially not in these times of civil war. Giving to the natives weapons, finding and encouraging leaders, leaking intel about the German garrisons. A better man than Schenk would have done this a long time ago, instead of idly daydreaming treason. The Reichskomissar had found in himself endless depths of willpower to endure being a cog in this infernal machine, but not a shred of determination to put a stop to this horror without end. Torrents of discipline applied to cowardice. Heroic amounts of efforts to do the wrong thing, day after day.\n\nIn the distance, the changing of the guards. Good lads, here to avoid a life of drudgery in Germany. Men worried to death about news from the fatherland. Soldiers who trusted in the Reichskommissar to save them from the South Africans and their American sponsors. Perhaps it was not too late for Schenk to be a coward again, and choose the easy path? The lie, the pretense of following orders tempted him. The mask of doing the right thing, hung over an empty man who had successfully stopped thinking about his guilt. A medecine making the pain tolerable, easier to bear. Schenk wished he had the strength to face himself, to put a real end to the pain instead of meekly bearing it.\n\nA decision. Grim certitude, as the Reichskomissar began drifting to sleep. No matter the costs, Schenk knew where his heart would lead him in the morning."
ANG.1.a:0 "To attempt to save Angola."
ANG.1.b:0 "To try to defend Germany."


ANG.4.t:0 "Under The Hot Sun"
ANG.4.desc:0 "It always took great efforts or terrible circumstances to gather all three Reichskommissar in the same room. Amazingly, Müller and Hüttig had agreed on a general strategy meeting with Schenk. Nothing short of a miracle, however, would have made both of his colleagues pleased to be in the sweltering war room.\n\nIt had not taken thirty minutes spent doubled over maps of South African troop deployment before Reischkomissar Müller suggested adjourning for the day.\n"Surely you jest, Herr Müller." Hüttig was the first to respond, picking his words carefully. "These are only preliminary talks. I'm currently bringing the two of you up to speed to strategic considerations that I've said for years are crucial to African security."\n"Of course, of course." Müller smiled. The agreeable expression never faltered. "I've read your memos. Well, most of them. My general staff keeps me updated, yes? But it's been a long day. Why not let our underlings carry on the topic while we get some drinks, get out of this heat."\n\nHüttig's contempt was briefly set alight by wrath. The instant passed, leaving Schenk wondering if this moment of fury had gotten through to the smiling Müller. "Gentlemen." Schenk began. Hüttig's gaze made him stumble for only a moment. "The day will be much longer if we dally."\n"Of course it will. I do wish I could have sent only underlings, to deal with you two. There's a war out there, yes? Why am I stuck here explaining basic concepts instead of fighting with my men?"\n"You'll be back there as soon as we are done discussing this. The same goes for you Müller. Now, back to the task at hand."\n\nThe afternoon went on. Müller, despite his boredom, proposed a few good ideas. Hüttig, forgetting his distaste, discussed operational matters. With the end of the day, some agreements as to the joint German strategy had been reached."
ANG.4.a:0 "No fighting in the war room."

ANG.5.t:0 "The Winds of War"
ANG.5.desc:0 "They call his domain the Airport of Afrika and the bureaucrats appointed Schenck to its head. After all, who better to run a whole continent's air fleet than this man who did nothing but fly? They are not wrong about his love of flying because the bureaucrats barely had enough time to brief him about his upcoming orders - orders from Germany that he couldn't care less about.\n\nHe thinks of the orders as he sits down in the controls of his cockpit: modernize the aging air force in the region for their continued "aerial pacification campaigns in Westafrika" as well as for "intra-regional aerial support for your fellow Reichkommisariats". Schenck despises how the memo tried even a little flattery in the end: "You are our most valuable way into and out of Afrika and we do appreciate your continued cooperation in this endeavor". For God's sake, they aren't even combatants. There is nothing left in Westafrika but small mud huts to bomb and the absolute dunces in the Luftwaffe call it "training". Sometimes, he wonders if he should have died flying during the War. A burst of tracers going right through the cockpit - life ends, curtains fall, his Vaterland and family would remember him a hero, and that would've been the end of it: dying as he lived - mid flight. Schenck sighs. Let us implement those new designs from Germany and get our workshops tooled up for the upgrades."
ANG.5.a:0 "Easy postings no longer."

ANG.6.t:0 "A New Source of Technicians?"
ANG.6.desc:0 "The Reichskomissar's signature was all that was missing from the document. A new order, allowing recruitment of natives into the airforce. Not as pilot, of course, but as ground crew and support staff. Schenk sat at his office, head between his hands. As usual, indecision ate all of his resolve.\n\nThe idea present in the orders would make his officers howl with rage. No matter how desperate the situation, the proud men of the Luftwaffe would never stoop so low as flying planes maintained by the natives. Better to keep up a pure, if increasingly ragged, air force, the men would say.\n\nBut there were only so many proud aryans available down here. And without air cover, many more Germans would die fighting in the south. The Reichskomissariat's air bases were already running into staff shortages. Maintaining planes with only a few hours a day of rest was an incredible risk. Using locals to maintain planes under German supervision would free up an immense amount of resources. Until now, the native employees had only been trusted with grunt work such as refuelling planes and moving around equipment on air bases. With this new order, the most tedious to maintain planes would be offloaded onto natives auxiliaries , letting the experimented technicians tend to more modern and complex planes. To minimize dangers of sabotage, the men could be recruited in trusted African SS auxiliaries units. And perhaps, when all of this would be done and gone, the African technicians would have some money to bring back to their community. This golden future was most likely only hypothetical. But what was one more lie for the Reichskommissar's tired conscience? Positive dreams helped keep the clouds away.\n\nIt would take much willpower and energy to get the new technician corp started. Perhaps it would be simplest to rely on the German staff entirely. If the alternative was to entrust their critical planes to savages, Schenk suspected his men would give it their all. No matter the choice the Reichskomissar made, he knew that the men of the Luftwaffe would roar with indignation that he'd even considered letting the Africans anywhere close to their fighter jets."
ANG.6.a:0 "We need technicians, no matter how much the old ones complain."
ANG.6.b:0 "Trying to use the natives isn't worth it."

ANG.7.t:0 "The Rest and Rehabilitation System"
ANG.7.desc:0 "There are few men on earth who work harder than a Südwestafrikaner pilot. With the Südwestafrikan Luftwaffe carrying the brunt of the air war burden in South Africa, aircraft and personnel were pushed to their limits. Pilots conducted so many bombing runs in a span of a few days that they began to lose count and memory of their missions. Aircraft were pushed past the limits of their maintenance cycles to squeeze more flights out of them, so that the swamped maintenance personnel may have had time to ready the currently grounded aircraft for another cycle of sorties. The entire system was pushed to its very limit.\n\nWhat wasn't working, however, was the pilot side of this cycle. A sharp increase in pilot-error incidents, some of which were deadly, indicated to Luftwaffe command that pilots needed something of an improved rest cycle.\n\nThe result of these observations has led to the development of a truly revolutionary rest cycle for Südwestafrikan pilots. Air crews have been shuffled around between air wings, so that the balance of personnel may be optimized. From there, pilots will partake in a day-on-day-off system. Upon the first day of this two day cycle, we aim to place air crews upon twelve hours of high readiness, followed by twelve hours of low readiness, where there should be ample time for rest between sorties, should the call come. On the second day of their cycle, pilots shall, in essence, be granted a day of leave so that they may rehabilitate and rest for the trials of the next day.\n\nSuch a process won't allow us to squeeze quite as much out of our pilots as before, however, their combat readiness will be much greater, and hopefully we won't see any more deadly incidents involving pilot error."
ANG.7.a:0 "They'll get some rest, if not relaxation."

ANG.8.t:0 "The Assistant Technician Corps"
ANG.8.desc:0 "The men filed in an orderly fashion into the base. The jeers of the instructors as well as the orders to move faster did not seem to faze them. Every candidate had been selected from the African SS auxiliary corps, and iron discipline had long been a fact of life. Now came a new opportunity for a higher payed job far, far away from the most dangerous sections of the frontline.\n\nReichskommissar couldn't help but suppress a smile as the day went on. He had chosen the first batch of instructors personally, to make sure they would teach the Africans wel, no matter their personal dislike of the natives. As Schenck monitored the first day's progress, he saw the instructors surprised at the speed of their charge's learning. The natives had after all often been tasked with endless tedious mechanical work, judged too degrading for their German betters. Given the opportunity to tinker with new machines in a less stressful environment, the assistant technician candidates seemed to relish the opportunity.\n\nThe Reichskommissar knew that it would not always be smooth sailing from that day on. Many would be thrown out as the endless long shifts would begin to pile on. Many others were likely to try to sabotage planes, or at least be arrested on false accusations by paranoid German supervisors. Schenck would not be able to be everywhere to enforce the rules he had handed out to the trainers. At night, worries of German pilots dying to sabotaged planes alternated with nightmares of tortured and wrongly executed African assistant technicians. But for today, the Reichskomissar could not help himself but feel pleasure at the sight of men given an opportunity to learn about interesting machines, and to better their future through better pay."
ANG.8.a:0 "Let's hope we can eliminate our maintenance hours deficit."

ANG.9.t:0 "Unexpected Promotion"
ANG.9.desc:0 "Valdemar hadn't expected to ever see the war planes from so close. Once he had merely helped clean them, spending hours scrubbing away grease and fuel residues from the fuselage, making sure the joints were free from any extraneous grease after each flying mission. Now, the new technician worked in the belly of the flying beasts, helping to verify circuit integrity and fluid levels for various systems.\n\nEach test Valdemar completed in double, or triple. The punishment for mistakes ranged from verbal abuse to detention as suspected saboteur... Or worse. But the work in itself was much more interesting, even throughout long shifts. New planes were always coming in, and figuring out if they required more in depth technical attention was an interesting challenge. Now and then, the German engineers taught him new manipulations and techniques so they could offload more work onto him. This did not bother him too much, for now. The increased salary was good, and some of it was even given to his family week on week, to ensure collaboration from the new assistants.\n\nAround the hangar were more of the new assistant technician. It was good to work with fellow Africans. Despite the difficult and stressful work, Valdemar caught himself daydreaming about peace. The money would carry his family and himself for quite a while. And perhaps, the Germans would keep letting him work on their war planes? The best thing to do was to keep his head down... and his analysis of the planes correct."
ANG.9.a:0 "Work is never over."

ANG.10.t:0 "Dealing With the Devils"
ANG.10.desc:0 "Schenk looked at the typewriter in front of him. Ideas did not come to him easily. Blank page syndrome? Perhaps. Perhaps it was simply that the Reichskomissar had tried every public channel possible to ask his colleagues for resources in exchange for planes. Any new letters sent through the usual methods would simply be ignored. Schenk could not even be sure that Müller had read all his letters.\n\nThoughts of clouds, of the sky above Africa. No safe skies these days, no safe locations on the ground. The war raged on.\n\nMüller and Hüttig had blown him off. Even with the offer of planes crucial to any effort to win the war in South Africa, both Reichskomissar had told him in different ways that they had nothing for him, and that he was a fool to come begging for resources in such a time of crisis. The Afrika Schild was all together in this war, yet there would be no economic cooperation to go along the military joint efforts.\n\nPerhaps there were other ways. Schenk knew Müller was desperate for planes to keep the Congo safe. Schenk suspected Hüttig of needing planes for the chemical weapons he would never dare deploy. Perhaps some under the table negotiation to sweeten the deal could work?"
ANG.10.a:0 "Alright... Lets do this."

ANG.11.t:0 "Putting the Cards on the Table"
ANG.11.desc:0 "Thomas Weber sweated in the converted hotel. Poor ventilation kept the assembled representatives uncomfortable throughout the day. At least this helped speed along the negotiation process.\n\nThe Ostafrikan representatives didn't seem pleased to interact with their Südwestafrikaner and Zentralafrikaner colleagues. The men from zentralafrika were the usual types, futureless career bureaucrats filling Müller's empire of ignored paperwork. At least those guys seemed pleased to escape the doldrum of managing a failing business for the day.\n\nWeber had no idea how Schenk had pulled the other two Reichskomissariaten into this round of economical negotiation. The boss always kept his plans close to his chests, and his methods vague. Weber had been assured that the envoys from the other Reichskommissariat would be eager to negotiate, and that Südwestafrika's negotiating team could go hard. They were to offer planes and other assorted goods in exchange for supplies. No matter what kind of personal bribes or begging Schenk had had to do to get the negotiations started, Weber would see to it that the maximum amount of concessions would be extracted.\n\nAs the talks went on, the complexity of the trade routes and supply pipelines grew and grew. An exasperated Ostafrikan negotiator casually said that all this sounded more like an economic union than a simple trade deal. This candid outbursts began steering the assembly toward such a project. In the end agreements were reached by all parties, if only to get out into the night for some fresh air."
ANG.11.a:0 "It would be better to focus on Zentralafrika for the time being."
ANG.11.b:0 "Ostafrika remains our only avenue to success."
ANG.11.c:0 "We could always just bribe both?"

ANG.12.t:0 "A Pact Made in Blood"
ANG.12.desc:0 " In front of the few remaining foreign journalists and war correspondents, Reichskomissar Schenk stepped to the podium next to the representatives from the other two African Reichskomissariat. Wartime conditions made a gathering of all three Reichskomissar in one location unadvisable, and so Schenk found himself making a speech with mere aides to Müller and Hüttig to the assembled crowd.\n\n"In these difficult circumstances, as representatives of the fatherland in Africa, every Reichskomissar must stand together for the light of civilization against African barbarism and American degeneracy. The Afrika Schild serves as the protector of Europe in the continent; now, the Mutual Assistance Pact will enhance commerce and development across all German territories. Under supervision from my esteemed colleagues, I am proud to sign today a deeper brotherhood and partnership between German territories in Africa. From now on, the resources, factories and infrastructure of the black continent shall be joined into one, reinforcing the fatherland's logistics in its war with the South Africans."\n\nThe journalists barely lifted their heads up from their notepads. A few took pictures. The envoy from Ostafrika, a dour fellow, tilted his head ever so slightly toward the Reichskommissar. Schenk hastily added his signature to the treaty, before heading out of the back door. The journalists barely noticed his departure."
ANG.12.a:0 "Little time for protocol."

ANG.13.t:0 "A Day in the Jungle"
ANG.13.desc:0 ""Schenk, my friend, glad to see you."\nReichskomissar Müller's easy smile had not been altered too much by the war. Had his eyes changed a little? Schenk knew his colleague was a card shark with an impressive poker face. The pilot Reichskomissar could only hope that his own face did not betray too much fatigue.\n"Good to see you Müller. Came here to discuss the new trade routes brought forth by the mutual assistance pact." He clasped the other man's hand. Müller's smile turned quizzical as he thought about Schenk's words. Finally the Zentralafrikan shook his head. "Can't say I've followed that file too much, my friend. I've gathered a few eggheads that know the topic well."\n\nSchenk nodded. Müller's smile faltered for a moment. "About our last conversation. Did you..."\n"I did." Schenk said. "You were quite insistent about that particular condition for the trade talks.\n\nMüller's full smile returned. A hint of mocking within it? Or was it just Schenk's imagination. "Good, good. I'll show you to the ministers responsible for this. Now you'll excuse me, my generals wanted a chat with me.""
ANG.13.a:0 "Seems like Müller's not going back on his word... For now."

ANG.14.t:0 "Into the Heart of Darkness"
ANG.14.desc:0 "His colleague barely lifted his eyes from the desk where he stood as Schenk entered the non descript tent. Finding the OstAfrican's field headquarter had been a complex task.\n"Schenk. Why the hell are you here?"\nSchenk closed his eyes, opened them again. Hüttig was still focused on his map."The ressources you've promised. I need them."\n"And I need the fucking planes you promised." Hüttig looked up. Turned to face Schenk. Dark circles under the Reichskomissar's eyes, as under all eyes in German Africa lately. "To win this fucking war. Why the hell are you here? Don't you have troops to command?"\n"My generals are maintaining their portion of the perimeter. But they need supplies, and for that I need the ressources you promised."\n"You men would not be dying in drove if you had managed your land so poorly. Where the hell is your infrastructure? Why are all your fucking natives still running around instead of making bullets, guns, parts for your beloved planes?"\n\nSchenk held the other man's gaze. Nothing shone in Hüttig's eyes beyond cold mathematics. Slaves and resources in, guns and corpses out. The miserable bastard would not disturb his well oiled death camps that easily. Schenk should have known better.\n"Your planes are on their way. I want guarantees that you'll hold your bargain"\n"You have it. Now, out! I'm busy keeping the Americans away from your beloved airfields.""
ANG.14.a:0 "...It's what we have to do."

ANG.16.t:0 "Stuck Between a Rock and Hüttig"
ANG.16.desc:0 "Reichskomissar, as requested, we've continued to analyse the rising native tensions within our hinterland. After compiling intelligence two options present themselves to us.\n\nThe first is to continue on the current track. The hands off policy you've been using has always been a relief valve to internal pressure when compared to other areas in German Africa. Our previous fears of cascading unrests have been assuaged somewhat as the spread of trouble has slowed. However, to continue keeping the situation under control we would need to commit additional troops and supplies to patrolling the colony and isolating trouble spots until their anger burns out.\n\nTough times, however, also bring forth tougher solutions. While your desire to spare the natives as much as possible to keep them docile is well known, Reichskomissar Schenk, the time has come to consider tougher solutions. By rounding up known public troublemakers and marching them to Ostafrika's concentration camps where they'll be worked to death, we can remind the population that we do not have to tolerate their endless complaints. This is likely to further anger the natives, but these ungrateful bastards do not deserve the manpower necessary to let them act out their tantrums."

The surly German troops maintaining "peace" were forbidden from shooting them arbitrarily, as was known. Beatings, on the other hand, were distributed with abandon at anyone caught getting in the soldier's way.\n\nThings had been changing, off late, thought Joao sitting in the shade. He observed the troops marching away in the distance. These were no white foreigners, but villagers from up the Okavango river. Even their commanding officer was African, taking his cap off as he and his men walked past the village's chief. Perhaps the war had drawn another gaggle of Germans down south to fight the Americans. Perhaps all this was a ploy to earn the village's goodwill. It definitely seemed to be working. Villagers had a cautious spring in their step. The men of the village didn't give as wide a berth to the patrolling soldiers\n\nJoao was jostled from his daydreaming by another man sitting opposite him in the shade. Both began exchanging about the strange sight of African security forces. It was easy to reach an agreement; black or white, the soldiers remained capable of corruption and cruelty. Yet, it was good to have something to hope about. Perhaps the African soldiers would continue to careful about the community's order and stability? Only time would tell."

So many faces, Angolans he had abandoned. So many half hearted development projects he had begun, too afraid, too cowardly to take the final step and try to set the Africans free. No matter. The war had to be won. The last thing the Germans and natives needed was for devastation to visit the interior of the Reichskommissariat.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the report. More devastation. Terrorist attack by the MPLA. Agostinho Neto. The Reichskomissar tried to blink away the fatigue. So many rebels. Critical infrastructure, torched. German and native fighters in the south, deprived from food and ammunition. Schenck felt an unusual spark of anger, despite himself. He held on to it, magnified it, did his best to nurture the irritation into real fury. Had he not done as much as he could to help the locals, during his stay as Reichskomissar? Did the native elites not know about how bad things were in OstAfrica, how worse they could be here? Agostinho Neto certainly knew, and yet he led his rebels against the Reichskommissar forces in this most critical moment. Schenck's fatigue helped dull his logic, helped cloud his self-loathing, helped him forget the righteousness of the rebel's cause. No, the rebels were the villain, trying to cast the region into chaos on the verge of the American offensives. For the good of the region, and to save both Germans and natives, the MPLA had to be stopped."

It was gnawing at the conscience he still had. It was also a nightmare, just listening to it cry out. But there was no way to reverse what he resentfully thought he was forced to do.\n\nAlways, he would blame himself for not doing more to calm the natives down. Always, he would feel the acid of his excuses corrode his will and his composure. Always, he would keep in mind the sight of countless natives being pushed around by exhausted and exasperated troops.\n\nThey were shoved out of their dwellings. They were brought out of their villages by gunpoint. And then they were carted away to the labor camps in Ostafrika. Schenck's heart endured one more stab, one more painful thought; he knew what would happen once they arrived there, and he regretted that he could do nothing but watch. He felt his chest tighten, his hands becoming chilly with the ruminations.\n\nHis conscience remained, begging him to do something. But the man could not lift a finger to answer it. While he desperately sought to correct it, so that the guilt which stubbornly remained upon him may vanish, deep in himself he already knew that it just cannot be done.\n\nAnd so long as he shivered in the cold air, he remained upon the balcony, eyes unable to shed tears. Only the sky he had often taken to would be a witness to the deepest of his regrets. And only his mind could excuse him of the consequences. Only his own treacherous heart would torment him again and again."

As best as anyone could tell, Schenck was as loyal a servant of the Reich as any other. Perhaps not the most dedicated leader or meticulous administrator, but nothing to worry about.\n\nIn truth, Schenck had long since abandoned all faith in the Reich he had served for so long. One dark night found him upon his balcony, trembling with fear and nerves as a small car wound its way up to his estates.\n\nUpon its arrival, three well-armed figures emerged from within the cab, along with a 4th from the trunk. He was tall, blonde, and spoke German with only the faintest trace of an accent. Schenck greeted him as special agent Reynolds when he shook his hand, and as "Sir" as he promised the allegiance and support of himself and those he could trust within his administration."\n\nThe plan was simple. Using Sudwestafrika as a base, the CIA would begin covert operations to find, infiltrate, and destroy the German operational structure within the region. The American's would win the war.

It didn't matter. They were SS. Discipline was their mother's milk, and darkness was their ally.\n\nThen the night sky yawned, and from its gaping mouth, fire poured down.\n\nAwaking amidst the explosions, the SS did not waste time. They raced between burning tents to the camps bomb shelter. Rifles in hand, they would wait out the storm, and rebuild anew.\n\nBut the bombs were not the only threat that night.\n\nFrom the bushes around the camp poured the Americans. They were hard men, wearing Green berets, cruel faces, and for some, necklaces of ears.\n\nTracers danced between the spreading fire, as the best of the Reich went hand to hand with the "freedom fighters" from a distant land. To a man they died fighting, a gun in hand and a snarl upon their lips, but they died nonetheless.\n\nWithin an hour it was over, and nothing remained of the camp but corpses and torn fabric.

The whip cracked, the fingers ached, and the whip snapped. One of the overseers was new. A tall fellow, well-credentialed but speaking German in a strange accent.\n\nThen from everywhere and nowhere, the fire came.\n\nA timer went off, primaries activated secondaries, and the overseers office blew apart.\n\nThe slaves looked up with dull eyes, to see the new overseer looking over them like the angel of mercy. They prepared for punishment, if not death, but neither came. Instead, with a flourish, the man unleashed their chains and yelled at them to go.\n\nAs the factory burned, they fled. Some would be quickly recaptured and cruelly tortured for their insubordination. Some would make it to the bush only to die slow deaths of hunger. A few managed to find rebels or villagers to take them in, and dedicated their lives to revenge against their former masters.\n\nAs reports of yet another factory sabotage streamed in to the Reichkommisers office, Hans Hüttig raged.

The savannah heat did little to break the ice that encased his anxious heart. He sat, staring at the phone which rested squarely in front of him, waiting for the courage to arrive which would finally allow him to pick up the earpiece, and dial the number he had been given. All the other matters of his office, bar the most urgent, he had relegated to his subordinates. All he had to do was make the call.\n\nSchenck fumbled with the card provided to him by intelligence, upon which was a number to dial, and instructions of what to say. The details were pre-arranged by a trusted intelligence officer, all he had to do was make the damn call. Battling his nerves, Schenck lifted the telephone to his ear, and swiftly dialed the number into the telephone, as if he were in a race against his own second thoughts. The line connected.\n\n"Hello," he said, his voice trembling, "is this the Southwest African Gulf Oil and Aviation Company? This is Herr Schenck. We can go straight to the point." he began, doing away with all pleasantries. Schenck sat in the soft, silent din of the telephone, wondering if something had gone awry.\n\n"Hello, Herr Schenck," answered a male voice at last. It was soft, relaxing music to Schenck's ears - even if the accent was rough and uncultured. "I am pleased to hear that you have decided to contact us. I shall cut the chatter." A brief pause. "How are you, Herr Schenck?"\n\n"I am fine," he mumbled, "fine. Let's begin." Schenck realized at this point that he had committed to something from which he may not turn back, and found a few ounces of confidence. "I will put things simply. I wish to establish a working arrangement between our organizations. Given time, I believe, our people could become... something of mutual benefactors." Schenck finished, as he ran out of words. He sat in silence, as a reply took nervously long to come.\n\n"Mister Schenck, your proposal is... substantial.

Waiting for it to ring. He tapped his fingers. His legs restless and begging him to move. Rivulets of cold sweat travel down his face, leaving stark, bright trails against the orange light of the savannah's setting sun. Soon night would fall, and the appointed hour would arrive. Where is the call?\n\nA ring. Expectantly, Schenck lifted the receiver, only to drop it with a grunt. "I don't care," he said, "handle it however you want." He put his cool hands against each other and then parted them, his anxiety coating his hands with perspiration. Where are they? He looked at his watch.

A ring. He picked the phone with enthusiasm. "Hello?" he said, his voice barely containing his excitement, "is this the Southwest African Gulf Oil Company?"\n\nA man's voice answered him, the American accent on his German palpable enough to throw Schenck off, "Yes, is this Herr Reichskommissar Schenck?

He needs guns, advisors, and ready-made support equipment sent his way. Nothing too much for Uncle Sam. Should the government agree to it, I can act as a mediator between the U.S. and Herr Schenck.\n\nHowever, I must urge caution in our dealings with him. There is no doubt as to what he wants - as detailed above, he needs guns, men, and equipment. The main question is thus: what for? What does a Nazi Kommissar desire to do that he needs American aid? No one quite knows what he intends.\n\nThe agency, and therefore the government, should be cautious in treating this Nazi war hero as more than allies of convenience. I still recommend that, at the very least, America should engage with him. Who knows what can be wrung out from involving ourselves in this unknown corner of the world?

As of a few weeks ago, he had granted access for the company's "technicians" to survey his territory. Files wrapped in blue and beige covers seemed to protrude from the pile, crags jutting out from the mountain's body.\n\nPrying one out from the pile, he opened it. A foreign national, presumably with a fake name, greeted his eyes, data and all. He saw their qualifications, an artificial life passing before his eyes. John Hopkins University, bogus degrees, all bound in clean ink and pristine paper. Deceit may have befallen all innocent eyes that dared to peer into the bureaucratic nightmare that he now faced. Schenck knew better, however. He started it. He was now in the eye of the storm. The next step was to chart his way out of it - and his heart faltered at the thought.\n\nHe picked up his pen and sat down behind his desk. Schenck had only needed to give signatures to a few dozen of them - and let America's eyes and ears into the Führer's realm. Whatever the risks were, he was ready. Schenck was a great man in the eyes of many, and now the world shall see him attempt to be decent. Let them watch, he thought. He had no care for his fame, for his tarnished and bloodied legacy. His hands reached out, not to grasp the warmth of the future, but to shelter what embers that remain. Let the Reich mock him, and the OFN lash him behind his back. He did not care.

Once again, he produced a card provided to him by intelligence, this time with a new number and new instructions.

"Herr Schenck!" it spoke, "How good to hear from you again!" it finished, with a chilling, deceptive kindness, as it waited for Schenck to make his move.\n\n"Well," Schenck replied, "I wished to inquire further upon the matter of our partnership.

"I hope you understand my position here. I am a liaison, not a plenipotentiary."\n\nSchenck had to be careful. Now was not the time to tell the Americans what he had in mind. "Mr. Lansdale, I can guarantee that the usage of such armaments would not be against Americans," Schenck said, masking his chattering teeth by speaking slowly and spacing out his words.

The secretary might not see it, but Schenck, sitting at his desk, trying to look as calm and collected as possible, was walking a tightrope.\n\n"The manifests are here, sir," the secretary said. Ever faithful and trustworthy, the short blonde man had proven himself a source of sorely-needed help for Schenck. It took a moment for Schenck to remember the young man's name.

Even without the Americans' denial of gun shipments over to his fiefdom, he would have needed to take a long, straight look at the Kommissariat's finances. Of course, today's focus was revamping his secret project. The Americans have thrown it off-course, necessitating a correction. However, Schenck would not be a good pilot without the benefit of foresight. He had to take some pills for his nerves, however.\n\nHis feet were restless. Schenck realized that he had mountains of work to do. He sighed. The papers in front of him had waited for work for years. He heard the aides in the next room, an excellent set of lads from the wombs of Germany herself. They were partying while he had to make precise clerical entries. Gritting his teeth, his hands moved slowly. The din was distracting him, and he had to concentrate. Why, he asked himself, did all mainlanders present themselves as savages?

On those roads, like ants, trucks carried the material produce of his domain, throwing reddish dust and clouding the afternoon light.\n\nSome of those would ferry what the Americans had demanded of him a time ago. If the Führer 's cronies discovered that he was shipping German oil to the OFN, he would be dead. A prospect which had brought him to his rarely-used office often as of late. He had to prove, using creative accounting, that he was in a trade contract with the South West African Gulf Oil and Aviation Company, a no mean feat.

"I understand," Lansdale had said, his voice sounding defeated, "we'll call you at a later date to discuss another avenue of American interests in your domain." At the very least, the talks had not broken down right then and there. He sighed, his hands trembling from the cold of his office. At least there was a way forward, and that his refusal had not sealed his project's prospects.\n\nHe stood up and peered outside. The vistas of South West Africa, his dominion, opened its lips and smiled at him, beckoning him. Schenck felt the desire rise in him, to run in those fields and fly on its skies. However, his eyes saw the land frigidly. His countrymen's - and his - hands were stained with blood. Whatever fire that had burnt in its flat, orange, almost-infinite horizons were now only embers. With whatever he had, he was determined to defend the vestiges of its hope. Whateverhe did, his sins would linger, and for that, he left time to heal all the wounds he had caused."

He had outlined what he had wanted, and on the face of it, they were not much. In the long term, however, whatever he had requested would play a key role in his project. Schenck felt the warmth of the day, carried by the light of the early afternoon. He had left the windows open.\n\nThe Reichskommissar's fingers twisted the receiver's wire. He still felt uneasy. "Medical equipment, for the most part," he said, trying to sound relaxed and laid-back, "radios, binoculars, backpacks, and rations." No guns. "This shouldn't be too difficult, right, Mr. Lansdale? I did not request weaponry. The American nation should be able to provide me with all I need."\n\n"You're right, Herr Schenck." Schenck's counterpart sounded calm, almost complacent. "This is not too much for America. However, all you had requested were also the tools for war. Ultimately, the decision does not lay with me. The President and the Agency would decide whether or not to send whatever you need. You understand my position, don't you?"\n\n"I do."\n\n"Trust me, I will try to put in a word for you, but only if you let me decide the next topic of discussion. We shall talk about the rich mineral deposits of South West Africa, and how the Company seeks to use it for the greater good of nations."\n\nSchenck had little choice. "Understood. See you later, Mr. Lansdale." He did not like Lansdale, but perhaps it was for the best."

They promptly left him alone, free to gaze into one of the packages that America had clandestinely sent him. It was an oblong green box, made out of wood. Earlier, the two men had carried this inside, but Schenck forbade them to look at its contents. Loose lips sunk ships. Satisfaction was no excuse to let one's guard down.\n\nOn his desk was the greatest treasure he had ever come to possess. American-made war materiel, practically the stuff of dreams for both Hüttig and Müller. Prying the lid open, he saw what the Americans had sent him. On a bed of hay - to cushion the delivery, he surmised - were a binocular, a first aid kit in a tin box, a compass, and an MRE package. The binoculars arrested his attention immediately. What would it feel like to look at the world through American lenses? He picked it up, scattering into flight strands of hay, and set it onto his eyes.\n\nThrough the windows of his office, the South West seemed an arid, wild land. Closer inspection, however, revealed the beauty of its nature. He saw rodents, lions, wildebeests, and many more, scurrying around, living lives devoid of any conception of sin and redemption. For himself, there was no such hope. Not anymore. However, he whispered a cold, empty prayer. He could see it plain as day, written on the walls of his office. German domination here would end, one way or the other. He wished whoever would inherit his domain peace."

It was something light, something almost trivial. Yet, the United States of America used their proxy to utter a single, world-shattering word: "no."\n\nHis men had left him with stacks upon stacks of paper. A calculator lay beside the mess, ready to accompany Schenck into yet another venture into another session of overwork. All these negotiations had tired him, and he wished he could go a day without worry or anxiety. The medication helped soften his nerves, at least.\n\nHe recognized that this nervousness and anxiety would never go away. Schenck had gone too far. If weeks of overwork were all it took to redeem himself and his actions, he would accept it, every time. However, as he looked outside, to his favorite panorama in the world, he felt the sun's low, sleepy gaze alert something in him. He had to do his work and do it quickly. His time was growing shorter by the minute. The hand on the clock shaved a second by every tick. The project must be done."

My territory has a lot of metals in it - you'd have to specify which ones you want." Of course, Schenck had to agree to whatever exchange that occurred, but it helped to know one's enemy. It was half the battle won. The Reichskommissars Hüttig and Müller were unknown factors. Should they learn of his betrayal, they would abandon him in an instant. He had to be careful.\n\n"To tungsten, chromium, and everything you can sell besides. Do not worry, Herr Schenck," Lansdale lowered his tone, "we would pay fairly for it.

At the outset of his career in German aviation, Schenck never expected to ask for favors from an American political operator. Yet, here he was, consorting with traitors to his Fatherland.\n\n"Fine," Lansdale said, his tone curt, "have it your way. I should warn you that I shall put it to the Agency, and therefore the President, in the bluntest way possible. I apologize, Herr Schenck, but I am as loyal to my country as you are yours.

These men would enter as mercenaries, foreign nationals that Schenck had hired to train his army.\n\nIn reality, however, they were Americans. All the paperwork that laid before him was an excuse to let them in. Müller and Hüttig would not suspect a thing. They would perhaps even welcome his overtures to making a more competent and elite land force. Schenck did not intend such a thing - the Americans and the Germans were the enemies of his secret project, and both think that Schenck was their useful puppet. Oh, how wrong were they.\n\nIt was a momentous occasion. For a time, the veil of darkness that had descended upon Schenck since his first days as the Reichskommissariat was lifted.

His hands trembled, cold sweat mixing with the frigid night of the savannah, but he continued regardless.\n\nThis time, he was reviewing a long list of soldiers due for a promotion. The Americans, expectedly, had rebuked his request for advisors. Lansdale was the savvy diplomat, and Schenck was not. He knew he should have listened to the American. Now, however, he was coming up with an alternative, stop-gap solution. It would not do much in the grand scheme of things, but he would make it as pilots always did - adjust the course of his flight to meet his destination in time.\n\nTomorrow he would address all his soldiers and hand out medals to the most experienced ones. In place of actual American personnel, he would substitute his own. His Reichskommissariat's officers were far from the expertise the Americans could provide, but what can he do? He shrugged.

More than forty percent in the critical steel production sector. These are not light requests."\n"We do not make them lightly, nor do we aim to waste your time, Herr Schenck. Our continued partnership is of great risk to the American nation, and to the career of several of our men in the African continent. You understand this, do you?"\n"I do. Give me some time."\n"Please hurry Herr Schenck. Our lawyers can contact yours to spin up another web of consortiums and private interests to obscure the transfer. If you'd like, some money can be kicked back to you personally, yes? The privilege of doing business with you is great".\n\nClick. Dead silence.

The South West African Gulf Oil and Aviation Company must provide certain guarantees for our...constituents within the area." Schenck found it difficult if what he was feeling was a modicum of satisfaction for himself, or just the heat of his anxiety pounding down upon him. "Südwestafrika has complied with our terms so far; however, guarantees for Südwestafrika are not what I want. I must ask that the company can extend political and security guarantees to Angola." Schenck said\n\n"This, this secret...project...that you've been talking about, this is it, isn't it, Herr Schenck? After all this time, this is what the secretive buildup was all around..." Landsale said, his voice trailing off. The eerie silence besides a small buzzing plunged a dagger of doubt, worry, and anxiety deep into the Reichskommissar's mind. "The company had not expected these drastic changes to certain parameters of our business agreements. Of course, these changes are not necessarily out of potential Agency reach, nor Presidential, for that matter, but realize, Herr Schenck, that doing so could end up generating a political scandal unlike anything anyone's prepared to handle at the moment. We will be back in touch soon, Herr Schenck." Landsale said...\n\n"I hope so." Schenck said, as Landsale's hang up produced a buzzing which burst into his ear drums. Although the paperwork had slowly grown over the past few deals, Schenck couldn't help but step away from it all to peer through his office's windows.

However, all the laborious pen marks stopped as a series of knocks addressed his door. "Um, Reichskommissar, sir, the private message you had told me to personally deliver arrived." the boy, Wilhelm, said. "Give it here, boy." Schenck said, tearing the letter from his hand, as the boy closed the door. Schenck tore open the letter, sitting down on his desk as he read through the letters.\n\nSchenck's mind became a furious storm of emotion as he read through the document. Landsale had done it. "In accordance with the acknowledgement of the plans, the United States shall extend a guarantee for the independence of the nation of Angola emerging from the Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika..." Sure, Scheck could have acted as any other man would have upon the success of a plan as difficult and dangerous as the one he was undertaking. But Schenck was no other man. Schenck was not a man who could simply allow himself to pleasure himself for these accomplishments. Not after what he has done. The Nazis, and he himself, as their ace pilot, had already corrupted far too much of the world, and, thus, this was no victory. This was not even a sliver of redemption for what Wolfgang Schenck had done to the world, in his mind. Nay, the shadows had grown far too large for that to happen.\n\nSchenck locked the dangerous notification away in the drawer of his desk, alongside another fully loaded pistol like the one strapped to his side.

He rushed to his desk drawer to take a few pills and down them with the hot water on his desk.\n\nHowever, as he consumed the pills, the words of the newest report that had arrived on his desk continued to scratch and slash their way through the man's mind. The manilla folder, containing documents with words highlighted in red such as "United States' inability to afford such a crisis," "other means of support in the program," and, what was for Schenck the most harrowing of all, "No." Desperate, he tried to find a way out of the disappointment and darkness that had consumed him; yet, wherever he turned, he simply found greater points of sadness. Trying to find relief, Schenck opened the one drawer he hadn't opened in months. The one containing the beautiful jeweled necklace that Angolan woman had worn. The one whose body he found lying in the dirt road of her village, torn to shreds as the village had been by one of his air squadrons. Walking in his office, he looked at the necklace, studying it for all of its beauty, representing Angola itself in Schenck's mind.\n\nFinally, Schenck began to assault the wall of his office, punching it over and over with the fist clutching the gemmed necklace. Once his knuckles were bruised and bloodied, and his anger released, he opened his palm, looking at the blood dripping down the necklace.

What he thought were wind marks in the sand dunes, Oberstleutnant Pasche realized in growing panic, were instead drift lines left by waves. He considered turning the convoy back, but quashed the thought just as easily; even he knew it will take nearly a half-day's travel to return from where they had left. Seawater will soak his engines in less than an hour.\n\nBarring a miracle, Pasche had just surrendered a regiment to the sea.

Yet softened sand soon gave way to their friction and weight, and the convoy ground to a halt half-submerged in seawater.

The Reichskomissar's tendency to procrastinate had caused a veritable avalanche of paperwork to accumulate on his desk in these uncertain times. Now, one set of documents was arrayed in the middle of the leaning tower of forgotten bureaucracy.\n\nHans Hüttig's proposal for the formation of the Afrika Schild, a mutual defense organization. The eastern Reichskomissar had been quite insistent that the deteriorating security situation made military cooperation unavoidable. That all proud Germans in Africa should close ranks together and avoid the civil strife that had befallen Germany. The merest hint of hesitation by Schenck had been commented on negatively by the eastern Reichskommissar, who asked in a deadpan tone if Schenck felt he had any failing to hide from his colleagues. Hüttig had gone on to say that Ostafrika would feel no problem operating in what was another region of the Reich, no matter what, especially on matters of national security. Hüttig had painted him in a corner. Reichskommissar Schenck knew not what Müller thought of all of this, only that he had also acquiesced to Hüttig's demands.\n\nAn hour had come and gone before Schenck had signed everything Hüttig required, and put the paperwork in order. The former aviator looked at the window. The waning sun cast its crimson light throughout the office. How much the Reichskommissar would prefer to be away, flying in the sky. Instead, he picked another pile of documents. Getting rid of some of the paperwork would be good, if only to stop his desk from caving in on itself."

ANG.227.desc:0 "The transmission had come in through secure lines in the early morning.\n\n"South Africa's projected civil strife is a great opportunity to improve the security of the Reich in Africa. By supporting a Boer takeover of the South African state, we can destroy an unfriendly regime that has served as little but of a stooge of American interests. With total control of the sub saharan region, OFN shipments of aid to native rebellions will cease, as will the danger of open entry of South Africa into the OFN."\n\nReichskommissar Schenck did not know whether to laugh or cry at the message from his eastern colleague. All three Reichskomissariat in Africa were on a collision course with the Americans in South Africa. Schenck knew that the forces present in all three colonies would never break the South Africans fast enough to pre-empt American help. But what could be done? Hüttig would not take "no" as an answer. With Europe ablaze, the man would likely not sleep until certain that his model colony would withstand the coming chaos. And he would not take opposition from the other two Reichskommissariat lightly.\n\nSchenck cursed Hüttig. Schenck cursed Müller, who would no doubt get into this war as a fun reprieve from his hunting. Most of all, Schenck cursed himself. His incapacity of saying no to the Ostafrikan madman would now bring war to Namibia and Angola. The little good he had managed to do for the locals would be erased by the winds of war."

ANG.228.desc:0 "Thys van der Oelsen was no man of politics. His calloused, dirty hands were not those looking to write statements, craft legislation, or prepare a speech; rather, he had been born, raised, and grown in the mines, venturing deep within the Earth with a great respect towards the very rock which earned him his living wage. Now, after all these years, these rocks had seen nations rise and fall, none of which was Oelsen's concern, to be fair. All he knew and wanted was in that mine, for it's bounty granted him his money, which granted him his food, and his home by which to share with his wife and children. Sure, it gave a cough, but that was a price he'd pay for the happiness of his life. Unfortunately, though Oelsen was no man of politics, it would be foolish to not see that it intruded into his life. Now, everyday he ventured into those minds to retrieve those precious diamonds, he had to show the tiny little American shits in the Army his papers, something about "guaranteeing interests for South Afraican democracy." Yeah, whatever the fuck that meant, in Oelsen's mind, he just knew it meant they got a cut of the diamond share. Shaking his head and wielding his pickaxe, he ventured into the mines, preparing to head down the elevator into the shaft.\n\nHowever, Oelsen stopped in his tracks as an unfamiliar noise shook through the entirety of the cave he had entered. A plane, but not one of the typical American bomber or fighter jet that passed through. No, this one was different, and it was big. Oelsen only had enough time to turn his head before he heard a swirl above the cave which roofed him, while seeing the running away of American soldiers and South African miners, before the entirety of the cave was rocked to its core. Dust flew, men fell, and the elevator he was about to enter snapped from its cord, and kareened down the shaft to those mens' deaths. Oelsen turned, only seeing darkness as the front of the cave had been shut in by thousands of pounds of rocks blocking the entrance. He ran over, and realized that if he didn't work his way out now, he never would see the light of day again.\n\nHours upon hours did Thys van der Oelsen claw and pickaxe his way through rocks and rocks. He just barely heard the cries and shouts of Americans and South Africans as he made his way through all the stone, even finding the occasional body buried beneath the rubble. But the fight was exhausting. He could try and try, again and again, but the more he did, the more the oxygen escaped his lungs. Finally, after hours, the cave got darker and darker for Oelsen, who decided he needed some rest, and shut his eyes, losing the strength to worry about the lack of oxygen reaching his lungs as he rested, until he stopped breathing."

ANG.229.desc:0 "Second Lieutenant Redford led his platoon through the jungles of Central Africa, having been assigned to one of the newest scout routes that command could provide. Frankly, compared to the typical firefight with some of the Krauts, or some of the other fuckoff assignments they were given, like that one time they had to help out some African guy cause he lost his cows, this was a dream for his more than bored platoon. If there was anything he demanded from his platoon, it was to show the rest of the boys back at the compound that they were the top brass when it came to courage.\n\nRedford raised a silent fist into the air for his platoon, hearing the crumpling of Jungle leaves cease as everyone understood the order to halt. The sounds of a crackling campfire alerted the men, and looking out into some of the brush, they found their culprit. "Hancock, what do you see?" Redford asked, as that private began to scout through his scope into the brush. "Three figures I can see, sir, one standing, two sleeping, some sort of fucking camp, sir." Fuckin' mercs, careless as all hell, as always. "Alright, on my go." Redford said, getting his men ready to fire into the brush at the camp. 3...2...1...and the gunfire started, Redford's platoon lit up the camp, as bullets flew and not a single shot came back. "Bingo, move up." Redford said, a smile forming on his face.\n\nThe men pushed forward, still, and emerged through the bush into the camp. Of course, the standing guy had some standard German utilities, with a mercenary patch to boot, just as Redford figured. But, as the platoon marched forward, they realized this wasn't a normal camp. The two "sleeping" men didn't have shirts, and were all cut up, and were dead by the time they launched their attack. It was there that Redford saw it: no eyes, only empty eye sockets with American dog tags wrapped through the skull. Hands already cut off. Redford heard Hancock vomit behind him, as he looked over to the third corpse, where he saw bloodied stumps for legs, where one was in the fire and the other was shoved into the corpse's mouth, along with being disemboweled.\n\n"Americans. These were fucking Americans, sir." Private Boggard said behind him, disgusted, nearly crying. "Radio command, we gotta let them know about this shi-" Redford began, before he noticed the rotten stench coming from next to the shack, where a huge tarp covered something, and flies raged above."

ANG.230.desc:0 "The rudder of the engine brought Rudolf back to reality as he struck the side of the damn thing with his fist. "Fucking rubbish," he growled, the heat around him making it difficult to focus as the plane made way through the makeshift runway, shaking just a little bit. Eventually, though, luck favored him for once in his life, and the plane finally began to climb upwards. "Ha-ha! Finally!" His hands on the wheel tightened, and he took a deep breath. He had to do a bombing run, though he hoped that he wouldn't pass out from a heat stroke in the middle of doing so. There was plenty of ground and plenty of targets, so his trip would last for quite a while.\n\nThe sun was already beginning to set when he entered enemy territory. Thankfully, he wasn't really expecting much resistance in the way of anti-aircraft guns, considering that the bloody Africans were hardly prepared for war against the German machine. At least, that's what he hoped for - and that's what he was paid for. Looking down from his cockpit, he could spot a few settlements scattered wildly about with only gravel roads to connect them. One of them, however, seemed lit up, in a way that particularly struck him as odd.\n\nWith the reflexes of a bomber pilot, Rudolf turned the wheel and grinned. "American idiots," he muttered under his breath. "Sorry to say, but I believe that Rudolf has found you. Now if you just come out of your little hidey-holes..." With proper timing and the press of a button, he expended a little of his stock as the plane got just a little bit lighter. Nodding slightly to himself, Rudolf steered the plane towards his designated location, and smiled when he heard that oh-so familiar noise. He didn't receive a full reconnaissance report of this area, true, but he had already done the deed - he was sure that the village was up in chaos and shrieking flame after its light was doused. Perhaps there weren't any Americans there, but it was their fault for deciding to stick out like a sore thumb in this war."

Leon waved his hand and took a puff of his cigarette, taking the time to run a finger across his forehead. "Look, soldier, see those three out back?" He asked, pointing a thumb over himself. Tied up with rope and with bags over their heads, two white men and one black man sat on the back of the truck, flanked by two men in military uniform who carried rifles with them. The driver didn't look back, only nodded. "Yes, sir?" He asked. The sergeant gave the man a single pat on the back. "We'll show 'em both, son. Just follow my lead."\n\nWhile the shimmering sea was beautiful, the truck sputtering plumes of carbon monoxide and the South African soldiers getting shoved off the truck at bayonet-point wasn't. "May I ask you boys a question?" Leon asked, teeth grazing against the skin of the cigarette before he threw it out and snuffed it underfoot. There was no answer as they continued moving towards the sea. "Hmm. I see you don't speak the language of the victorious." He shook his head. "None the matter-" It was strangely accented and bordering on broken, but his English sufficed. "I have a question." One of the men, a white man, spoke up. "Y-yes? What's your question?"\n\n"Why are you being led here?" Leon asked, a pointed look and a sharp smile. "Wh-what do you mean?", "I am asking you why you are here, American. Well?" He raised his voice."Give me an answer!" As the captive and his friends were forced on their knees near the water, he froze up. "B-because w-we're b-b-being executed-" Leon let out a loud, exaggerated chuckle. "Ex-ac-tly! My, you are sharp, untermensch. It's a shame you're not on our side." He snapped his fingers, and returned to his precious German. "Thomas, Lennard, Christian! Ready your rifles! On the count of three, we shall send these men to nothingness! Now... three... two... one... fire!"\n\nThree gunshots ringed in the air. But in the seconds afterwards, the smoke began clearing up, and what remained were three men aiming their rifles at three men kneeling on the ground with water pooling near their knees. Leon's eyes flicked to the captives, who were shaking, in a tremor even, and then to his driver, who looked at Leon with surprise and hesitance. "Is... is that what you meant, sir?" The Feldwebel simply bared his teeth."

ANG.232.desc:0 ""Sarge, do you really think this is gonna work? I mean, shit, something like this against a tank?" Triggs asked, acting semi-informal for his ranking as a private, but no one minded at this depth of the jungle. "Triggs, think I fucking know? Look, the Captain's great at this shit, we've been pulling off hot shots against some of the meanest German fucks in South Africa. Who's to say that this isn't gonna work? It's a bomb with a fuckload of sharp shit put in, if the explosion doesn't kill them, and the steel doesn't kill them, you think a buncha guys who just lost their Achilles tendons are really gonna be that hard to put down?" Sarge said, as eloquent as ever. The squad shook their heads as they got ready to present it to the Captain.\n\nLooking over the small ridge, the Captain had his binoculars glued to the truck and the tank that was rolling through the African dirt road. "Um, Captain, sir, the bomb's ready. Packed and ready to shred whoever apart after 30 minutes of being placed, sir." Triggs said, a bit nervous given the bombasticness of the Captain. "Good work, Triggs. Now, everyone, get over here. You see those two? That's got a certain Major Karl Steiner inside, responsible for a good bit of the infantry coordination around these parts. Let's go pay a visit, gentlemen."\n\nIt took some time of trekking through the jungle to make it, but finally, the squad had made it in line with the truck and the tank, ever the more clueless about their positions. The plan was a go, the distraction was made, and the bomb was attached. Now, it was just time for the men to wait, see, and follow the small convoy as it made its way through the jungle.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the village in the distance came into view that they realized what was happening. It was already too late, in the Captain's eyes, as he raised a fist to halt the squad from moving forward. As soon as his fist touched the sky, however, the bomb finally went off, sending a great fireball into the air and a shower of shrapnel all over the village. Men, women, and children screamed, finding the dead and bleeding all over, whilst Germans swarmed, punishing the village for what had happened."

"Look, man. There it is. That's the plane that crashed." Archie bit his lower lip and used his forearm to wipe the sweat off his face. "I getcha Mark, I see it. Let's see if those fuckers survived." Marcus let go off his shoulder and sighed. "I don't know, man, you don't survive this shit."\n\nAs they got closer, however, it seemed that fate had something else in mind for the two Germans who were near the plane, on the ground and groaning in pain. Archie's grip on his gun tightened, and his body language became aggressive as he began moving forward. "Here they are. Like cockroaches - always survive whatever you throw at 'em. If only the fuckin' Germans decided to not grasp their slimy hands on Africa, then I wouldn't have to be here." Marcus looked at Archie warily as the other's eyes fixed themselves on who looked to be the pilot. "Yeah, you heard me motherfucker," Archie muttered, walking over the man as he flipped around the grip in his gun. "Hey, man, what the fuck are you thinking?" Marcus asked, looking around as if they just walked into an ambush. "The-"\n\nSomething blunt hit the pilot, and he let out a cry of pain which drew Marcus' attention immediately. It was Archie, slamming the butt of his gun against the man's back. "How about that, huh?!" He shouted, shoving a foot under the man's chest and turning him over. A kick landed unpleasantly against his stomach, and then another. "That's right - despicable fuckin' Kraut! Try this one for size!" Marcus hesitated for a while, then took a step forward. "Hey, Archie!" That barely caught his attention, but it was enough. "Calm the fuck down, man! What'd-" Archie whipped his head around to the co-pilot, who seemed to be struggling to say something. Putting his foot on the man's chest, Archie slid the gun under the man's throat and grinned. "That's right, Kraut. This ain't your territory anymore." Then, as he leaned back, he suddenly went for another kick, aimed right at the man's ribs. Marcus winced, and looked at Archie with a mildly scared and angry expression."

It was only the fact that he pitied the Africans that he even accepted the idea and not throw it out immediately, but perhaps that was what Schenck had in mind? It didn't matter now, of course, the philosophizing was meaningless while he and his squadron were slowly dying in the heat, waiting for whatever opportunity they would have to strike within the maze of trees they were surrounded by.\n\nWith enough time passed, however, Rolf and his men could spot something in the distance. It was a squad of soldiers, and he could very clearly recognize who they belonged to. Chuckling, he set down the binoculars and turned to face a German and Angolan. Since they didn't speak the same language, he made a few hand gestures. Bumping his fists together, making angry faces, then making finger guns. Thankfully the two of them seemed to understand, and with a sigh of relief, Rolf motioned to his machine gunner. "Keep an eye on those men," he said. "When they hear what's going on... wait until they closer. Once they're within firing distance, I want you to give it all you got." The gunner's face turned a bit queasy at the thought, and Rolf could notice it. He nodded, seemingly as a show of understanding. "I get it. You don't want to do this, but this is what we signed up for." Without seeing if he'd resist, Rolf pulled up his binoculars.\n\nThey could hear something in the distance, and very quickly recognized it as fighting. It was indistinct shouting, but the severity of it was sealed when a gunshot was heard. The man in charge of the squad forced his mates to quiet down, and, very carefully, they began traversing through the shrubbery, making sure that whoever was passing through would be unlikely to spot them. As they got closer, they could hear what was being said. It was a German - though not just that, they recognized some vague form of African. Hearing the situation deteriorate, they decided to speed up their movement a bit quicker. Past a few layers of trees, one of the men could even catch the glimpse of a soldier dressed in German military gear, but before he could open his mouth, he felt a ringing in his ears before something passed through his throat, then his lung, then his skull."

"Look, I don't want any of y'all fucking around out here. The Germans have this place down under lock and key, and the mercs aren't scared to do whatever the fuck it takes to scare us out. Keep your eyes peeled." he said, turning back around and continuing the march. Some of the men nodded in affirmation, some rolled their eyes after the hours of nothingness, and one man screamed his heart out after the spiel was finished. Everyone rushed to his side, as they realized what had happened, upon him falling over: a bear trap, a fucking bear trap, out here in the middle of the jungle. "Shit, those fuckin merc bastards, stay on guard! Carlyle, on me!" The Second Lieutenant said. Carlyle rushed to his side, seeing that his friend, Private Shaw, had been the one entrapped, gritting his teeth and crying as the steel legs sank into his flesh and crushed his bone. "Look, d-do what you have to do, I'll keep watch with the men, make sure he doesn't die." The Second Lieutenant said, running off with the platoon. Motherfucker. Carlyle took a good long look into the eyes of Private Shaw, before the half-hour of trying to pry it open. When the trap wouldn't budge, Carlyle took out his hunting knife and knew what he had to do.\n\nThe blood gushing out of the flesh was the hardest part, making it even more difficult to get a proper positioning to cut through the bone and sinew. Each stab into the leg, each delicate cut, done as fast as possible to make sure they could get through this and they could stop the blood from pouring out of the butchered flesh. At the very least, it gave him something to focus on to avoid thinking about Private Shaw's screams as they shoved a rag into his mouth.

The rebels failed to place enough explosives in any one spot to create holes big enough to ravage the roads. Neither have they made use of insurgency tactics such as placing mines to kill any of our men trying to investigate the bombing. As soon as our bomb disposal units clears it, engineers can repair the roads rapidly.\n\nCounter insurgency specialists are fanning out in the region and interrogating any native they find.

We suspect that one of the slaves brought in the bomb during the night shift, and agreed to collaborate with the rebels to ensure his own freedom in an escape attempt. Many civilian factories making goods essential to the war effort have been kept running around the clock, imposing a bigger strain on our security apparatus.\n\nHostages from the dead staff's family have been taken, and are being used to rebuild the factory.

 ANG.40.t:0 "Audacity - Dramatis Personae"
 ANG.40.desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck leaned back into the leather chair in his dimly lit office. The hour was late, yet he had no desire to leave his office. He lacked the will to carry himself away.\n\nFumbling as he uncorked a bottle of whiskey, he pressed the bottle to his lips and began to down as much of the toxic liquid as he could. Breaking to cough as his throat felt as if it had been ignited, Schenck placed the bottle back down onto his desk, alongside other various forms of empty alcohol bottles.\n\nHe needed to forget. Why would God not simply just allow him to forget? Schenck lingered upon the thought as he pounded back another swig of whiskey, breaking again only to hack out another series of coughs. What would it take to forget?\n\nIn a depressive bout, he thought of the atrocities he had signed off over the course of his career. Decent people killed. Men, women, and even children alike, so many were unable to escape the fuses of his bombs, or the barrels of his rifles. He wondered if it would make any difference if they knew he did not wish for any of this.\n\nSchenck took another burning sip of his drink, tears now rolling freely down his face. No, he thought to himself. This wasn't his fault. He never wished for any of this. None of the horrors in Africa were of his volition. They were all orders from Germania. One after another the orders flood in, mandating atrocities, ruining lives, killing thousands.\n\nWolfgang Schenck could not live with himself one day further if he continued following orders as he did. He would take the fate of the African continent into his own hands."
 ANG.40.a:0 "But my dreams aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be."

 ANG.41.t:0 "The Only Option"
 ANG.41.desc:0 "Schenck looked at the complete mess of papers which laid before him: infrastructure in need of repair or improvement, projected employment numbers under a variable of economic plans, factory plans in such-and-such province, militia strength here, native unrest there, and many more. His head began throbbing. He could not run away this time. The Angolan Plan was the only way out, because no matter how high he flew, his conscience would be there. He prayed that if Angola were not to become a great nation, then at least one strong enough to stand against their oppressors who would no doubt come back if they had the chance - German or otherwise. It meant a nation with water and sanitation, with jobs and income. It also meant a country that could fight, on the land and in the air.\n\nNo doubt the other Reichskommisars would be suspicious if he made any moves to execute the plan. Müller, as distracted as he is, would be suspicious of him using any materials not used directly for the war effort. Hüttig would be the worst of the two: any men kept in reserve would surely enrage him and the man is already paranoid as is. Schenck wondered if a free nation in the midst of this foolish war were even possible. Throughout history, there were many men more capable and more intelligent than he who could not achieve these very dreams. But he had to try. There was no other choice."
 ANG.41.a:0 "Angola must be free."

 ANG.42.t:0 "The Neverending Work"
 ANG.42.desc:0 "After trying to organize some of those papers, he sat down exhausted. More time had passed than progress made. He was tempted to get one of his secretaries to handle this but it was a secret project after all. He shuddered at the thought of someone finding these papers and snitching to Germany or, even worse, someone like Hüttig. God knows there were too many Hüttigs in this world. Even more tempting, however, was to soar again in the clouds but that was merely delaying the work that needed to be done.\n\nHe sighed. What was all this for anyways? A free Angola was so far away. So many maladies bedevilled the country: the poor infrastructure, the unruly fighting men, the complete absence of any proper industry. These all needed to be fixed before Angola could even have a chance at mere freedom let alone prosperity. Schenck closed his eyes for a moment and tried to imagine the Angola he wished to leave behind. Hopefully, when all this was said and done, as his plane would take off from these dusty airfields for the last time, he would leave behind a place which echoed the best of what was beating in the heart of every person. It would be a place where a simple man could provide an honest living for his family. A place where the children could run around in parks with their friends. A place where the wicked man would get justice, fair and promptly. Finally, he dreamt that this new Angola would become a place which would bow to no one except for Father Time - but only barely."
 ANG.42.a:0 "That's enough dreaming for now."

 ANG.43.t:0 "Nationbuilding 101"
 ANG.43.desc:0 "To make the plan a reality, the resources for a brand new beginning would need to be allocated soon. Angola needs to be stabilized and logistics set up for our plan before the other components of our plan are laid down. There was of course the matter of the war. Any material being shuffled around for anything other than the war effort would be scrutinized by our allies. Additionally, the German Civil War would not last forever. Should the victorious successor decide to intervene in this blasted war in Afrika, then there would be double the scrutiny for anything suspicious. Anything they did would need to be covered up and fast. Schenck furrowed his brow. He knew some men who could be trusted to handle the more sensitive parts of the plan.\n\nWhile he was writing down the details of who should handle what, Schenck was also thinking about how suspicious Müller would get. He would mostly be distracted by the war but the Afrika-Schild alliance would permit him access to our territory. If he realizes that more supplies are being used to merely "stabilize" our state, he could get suspicious. Given that we hope to not only stabilize it for just our colonial control, he would definitely be suspicious that we aren't trying our best to win the war at hand. If too many resources were allocated too quickly, Müller would no doubt act on his suspicions and put an end to our plan for good. Conversely, if too few resources were allocated, then our Angola would crumble if the Germans, or even the Americans, decided to reassert themselves."
 ANG.43.a:0 "We can't afford to rouse suspicion now."
 ANG.43.b:0 "We have to lay the groundwork for a stable state."
 ANG.43.c:0 "They will be ready, through our great sacrifice."

 ANG.44.t:0 "Building a Beating Heart"
 ANG.44.desc:0 "Schenck stared at the industrial planning blueprints: the first of many decisions to ensure the possibility of a new Angola. Ideally, what little industrial base we have should be used to further industrialize and consolidate the machines for the eventual liberation of Angola. Unfortunately, there was the problem of the war right now: the military factories are busy churning out guns, planes, ammo, and everything else for the war effort. Our civilian industries were too busy trying to keep things going business as usual on top of repairing the infrastructure damage caused either by American bombers or insurgent bombings in the countryside. It would be a close call, thought Schenck.\n\nOur industry was stretched thin as it is but even if we were to win the war, if the natives cannot survive their attempt at freedom, then it would all be for naught. A functioning industry base would be one of the foundations for both the survival and the prosperity of the new Angola we are trying to build. Then again, a loss against the Americans would undo everything as well. Maybe there could be a compromise made here that could benefit both of our objectives."
 ANG.44.a:0 "The war effort is too important, we have to maintain appearances."
 ANG.44.b:0 "We will do what we can to ensure a prosperous Angola."
 ANG.44.c:0 "We give them everything we have, as part of a debt we can never pay."

 ANG.45.t:0 "The Quality of Life"
 ANG.45.desc:0 "Utilities. Africa, as many know, is not exactly a very developed place. Always looked as just a place to make a profit, the colonizers never actually took much stock in helping the people survive, and that is what we must decide today. We could put a lot of effort into bringing up the standard of living around the country, but it will make Müller suspicious as we use more of his raw materials.\n\nWhen Schenck was reading about the utilities situation in this place, he was reminded again that Afrika was never prioritized for Germanization. It was a resource extraction scheme - no more, no less. However, for the Angolan Plan, utilities like modern plumbing should not be a luxury reserved for the wealthy Aryans in this country. If at all possible, these conditions must improve. Perhaps not as important as the other investment matters, we cannot neglect a basic human need in our pursuit of freedom for the natives. Inside the folders were development projects for water treatment plants, sewage lines, basic plumbing - all contingencies written up for the future "planned" wave of Aryan immigration that would surely settle down in Südwestafrika.\n\nThese plans were of course expensive in terms of materials and we would need the bountiful resources of Zentralafrika to make these plans a reality. Needless to say, it's a bad time to request wartime necessities for building up utilities. Schenck sighed. Any major development of utilities would no doubt raise suspicions from Müller. Yet, at the same time, he had to give the natives something to fight for - a semblance of prosperity and a headstart for the natives after so many years of oppression. That and the hope of minimizing the crushing regret that he did not do everything possible when this was over."
 ANG.45.a:0 "Building utilities while a war is at our doorstep is difficult."
 ANG.45.b:0 "Divert what resources we can."
 ANG.45.c:0 "Appropriate construction equipment and funds from the war effort."

 ANG.46.t:0 "The Art of Preparing for War"
 ANG.46.desc:0 "Whenever Schenck read these reports, he knew he was looking straight at stark reality. Glancing over the estimated militia strength, it seemed ironic that his light hand has actually made them more complacent in their bid for freedom. This unfortunately would not do. It would be an overstatement and a disservice to say that their fighting competence is especially strong. That is why we are hoping to send in some of our garrison to not merely garrison those villages but to consider training these fighters in secret. We have the infrastructure in place to gear them for fighting against any would-be oppressor. Perhaps they will not have the most advanced armaments, but they will not need them. They will fight dirty: with guerilla tactics and unconventional strategies to bleed the enemy dry so as to dissuade them from oppressing these lands again. Whether those oppressors be American or German, his men will train them to repel both under the guise of training them to be an effective militia.\n\nHowever, there is the issue of the war currently before us. Hüttig will be more than unhappy: he will be suspicious. If the men are not ferried towards the frontline, he may begin to question what exactly is going on in the home front side of things. Schenck shuddered. For a moment, he wondered if Hüttig had already known what was going on in these rooms - some rat or erstwhile spy leaking it to him. The bastard just needed one good piece of evidence to pull the trigger on him. Luckily for Schenck,this war should keep him busy. They shouldn't push their luck however. The madman could make a move before the war is over and the plan failing would leave Angola in a worse place than he found it."
 ANG.46.a:0 "Give them the scraps, we have to buy time."
 ANG.46.b:0 "Split the resources between us and them."
 ANG.46.c:0 "Arm and train them, they will face many challanges in the comming years."

 ANG.47.t:0 "Withdrawing The Guard"
 ANG.47.desc:0 "As Schenk looks at the last security reports, he ponders his next move. His plans are moving quickly towards completion, now all he needs is to allow the independence movements to take control of the territory and organize for the final push, but for that, they need time and space to gather the men, and roads and factories to move and supply them.\n\nTo address this fundamental issue, his mind already has the solution, but he first needs to assess the risks. He will order the garrison to stop protecting the villages from the rebels, and stop the patrols that regularly keep vigil over the roads and highways: this way, the rebels will slowly take over, and extend their control over Angola. As soon as that happens, more and more will join the freedom fighters, further strengthening their cause.\n\nHowever, this option is not free from risks. The other Reichskommissars will surely notice the empty garrisons and unguarded roads, and this will greatly increase their suspicions about our conduct: if he truly is to make this move, he'll need to be prepared for everything, even - no, especially - for the worst. The choices are straightforward: move fast, move carefully, or try to find a balance between the two. All these decisions have this deadly compromise: a stronger Angola or a less suspicious operation. Time to decide."
 ANG.47.a:0 "We cannot afford to have them jump the gun."
 ANG.47.b:0 "A slow withdrawal will suffice."
 ANG.47.c:0 "Redeploy all men to the front line, effective immediatly."

 ANG.48.t:0 "Cabinet - The Future"
 ANG.48.desc:0 "Schenck smiled. All the other parts of the plan were merely logistical. They were important, no doubt, but how they would govern would be far more important. Revolutions, wars, and far greater have been waged over this question by fools, geniuses, and madmen alike. It's quite a simple question: a strongman or a strong institution? Flexibility or liberty? The decision that will be made tonight could set the precedent for all the other leaders after him. The natives will not have the luxury of the Americans two centuries ago: two oceans, no enemies, and endless time to discuss and debate that question with their fellow countrymen. All they had was a weary man who desired redemption and absolution, who wished to no longer see a country bound up in the chains of servitude.\n\nIt would be possible to call a meeting of those dissidents for the drafting of a constitution, but it would take some misdirection and concealment just to hide the meetings as is. Otherwise, Schenck's men would just tap some hardy ex-revolutionaries on the shoulder, brief them in their cells, and then tell them to wait for the plan to execute. Schenck sighed. It was not the most ideal solution but better than gambling too much on this one issue and losing it all. He took another sip of coffee and reached for the folder of..."
 ANG.48.a:0 "Classified names and wills of steel."
 ANG.48.b:0 "Old court opinions and the ideals of free men."

 ANG.49.t:0 "Building a Brain Trust"
 ANG.49.desc:0 "Deep down in the hearts of all men burns the desire to be free - but some men smother that flame. Those men put their heads down to the till and plow the fields, to suffer servitude in exchange for peace - to be content with their lot. The folder before Schenck did not contain the names of those men. The names within the folder were people that even the likes of Hüttig dared not shoot for fear of making them martyrs. Not all of them were fighters nor even activists. They were not all united in ideological lockstep, but all yearned for a free Angola.\n\nThe question was how many to release to ensure a strong Angola. Any option taken would need to account for how much suspicion it would raise from Hüttig. We would need to issue out new names and convincing identities for these people. Time is of the essence. The more prisoners which need to be freed, the more difficult it would be to make it all unnoticed.\n\nIn selecting who to release, some of them were easier to slate for release than others: they had essential skills and education that would be vital to the new bureaucracy. For others, they weren't essential for the new government but would be useful in the new administration. Then, there was the craziest idea of all: just free them all. None of them deserved to be jailed for a second longer for desiring a free Angola. It would save him the burden of choice of who to free. Who could truly make that distinction? The conditions of the prisons were not the best and some who might have died were going to live if they were freed as soon as possible. If all were not freed, in him choosing to free some, he would condemn others to waste away for perhaps months longer. After mulling it over, Schenck thought it would best to..."
 ANG.49.a:0 "Free the most essential ones and keep it discrete."
 ANG.49.b:0 "Free all those who would benefit our new Angola."
 ANG.49.c:0 "Free them all and have one less thing on our conscience."

 ANG.50.t:0 "The Art of Deceit"
 ANG.50.desc:0 "Dr. Savimbi drove to the Schenck's office for a routine checkup. The appointment was for a flu that could possibly be contagious so the doctor thought it best to drive over to him. He entered the building with his doctor's coat and passed through security with no issues as his credentials were all solid.\n\nWhen he entered Schenck's office, Dr. Savimbi promptly took off his doctor's coat because it was still hot inside and he didn't wish to bother with it. There was no flu. The two men were here to discuss a great big table of identical satchel bags. Within each of them were numerous manila envelopes. Savimbi and Schenck walked around it - inspecting the bags and their contents. "As soon as you decide to authorize this, these satchels will go out to every single freedom fighter that we know of."\n\nSchenck looked over the newly printed papers.\n\n"If your men followed your instructions, then these forged papers were made with the same paper and methods that you do for all official documents in this country."\n\nSchenck held one up to the light to see the Reichsadler shining through and nodded in approval. He returned the document back in the satchel.\n\n"Hüttig would no doubt be suspicious even if the documents seemed real. The mere number of people entering the country would be suspicious. It would not be a problem to hand them all out but I just thought that you should keep the risks in mind. If you should decide to be more selective about the whole endeavor, we have a few drop-off points that would be more limited in access but also safer. What do you think?""
 ANG.50.a:0 "Just a few of them. We can't handle any more."
 ANG.50.b:0 "Prioritize the locations that have less scrutiny and minimize our risks in the more obvious spots."
 ANG.50.c:0 "Let's raise up some real hell for when we make our exit. Send them all out."

 ANG.51.t:0 "An Innocent Letter"
 ANG.51.desc:0 ""Dear Mr. Hüttig,\n\nIn light of our recent alliance and collaboration, I thought it would be best to offer some assistance in terms of lightening your load with regards to your prisoner problem. We have heard that you have jailed and imprisoned the bandits under UNITA who have made numerous cross border raids into your territory. Similarly, they have been a thorn in our side as well, and we have our own fair share of experience in rehabilitating these individuals to make sure that they will not attempt such brazen acts of chaos and discord in the future. I am sure that these subhumans have received their due punishment under your vigilant and efficient administration. My request is that you should hand over some of these troublemakers so that you may focus your full attention on the war effort so as to equal the load under our new alliance. Attached to this letter are the formalities associated with who we would be OK to transfer over to our prisons. We thank you for your excellent efforts in winning the war for the Reich and for the Afrika-Schild.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWolfgang Schenck""

 ANG.51.c:0 "Attach an aggressive extradition treaty."

 ANG.52.t:0 "Fanning the Embers"
 ANG.52.desc:0 "Schenck sat at his desk trying to think up the way to draft one of his last orders as Reichkommisar. He needed to write out what he was going to order for the men down in the villages. It was for their sake as much as it was for the natives: allow the partisans to run unfettered and let the troops escape with their lives. Of course the men wouldn't know that, just following orders. He wondered at the absurdity of the situation: his treason relied on their loyalty so that they, both the colonizer and colonized, may escape with their lives. If such a dilemma was supposed to make him feel better, it didn't. One more thing to hide from Müller who would no doubt begin asking questions if he wasn't distracted already. There wasn't much left to do now - most of the preparations for the Angolan Plan were laid and he could just tell them to pull out of the villages fast and deliberately. Müller and Hüttig could go to hell for all he cared - by the time they came a-knocking, he'd be in the air soaring towards a place that he could retire in peace.\n\nThen again, why risk it right before the end? If there was a screw-up, a leak, then it would all be for nothing. He would probably be able to escape but the plan would fail. Enough thinking, enough dreaming, time to decide."
 ANG.52.a:0 "Slowly and almost imperceivable. It'll take more time but it will be done soon enough."
 ANG.52.b:0 "Be selective about the pull-out. Make it justifiable."

 ANG.69.t:0 "A Wrench in the Wheel"
 ANG.69.desc:0 "Across all fronts of the South African War, the Südwestafrikans have garnered a reputation. This reputation, however, is not one of bold deeds or noble victories, but rather a reputation of seemingly systematic ineffectiveness. Anywhere the Südwestafrikan forces are poised to aid, their aid proves to be utterly ineffective.\n\nSüdwestafrikan aircraft buzz enemy targets harmlessly as air strikes almost always appear to land off target. The Südwestafrikan Kolonialgarnisons often arrive late for any movements they were poised to conduct. And not to mention the questionable validity of the reconnaissance reports coming from the Reichskommissariat. More often than not, they appear to cry wolf of enemy movements and imminent attacks. Sure enough, as the forces of the other Reichskommissariats dig in for hours or days and prepare for contact, no such contact arrives.\n\nYet unbeknownst to the other Reichskommissars, however, is that the Südwestafrikans have been highly effective. Effective not in combating the OFN, but in disrupting the campaigns of their fellow Reichskommissariats. Further discrete disruptive measures are planned, as well. Supplies will soon begin to arrive late, as others will be "mistakenly" seized by dissident groups within Ostafrika.\n\nSchenck sits comfortably in Windhoek, ready and willing to slowly lose this war of his."
 ANG.c0.a:0 "They don't even know what's hitting them."

 ANG.76.t:0 "Right Under His Nose"
 ANG.76.desc:0 "The squeak and rattle of the aging, dark wood he waltzed upon within his office never ceased to irritate him; however, in Schenck's mind, it was but another expense at his soul for the actions he'd done, and a constant reminder of the evils he would have to commit to set things even slightly right in his world. And now, this annoyance made manifest revealed itself to harbor another avatar, as the vexing child of a secretary sat behind his desk, donned with the fierce demeanor of a die-hard National Socialist.\n\n"Sir, it would take a simple turn and gaze at these reports to give the figures: Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig's production growth is exponential, and Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika's lack of a structured measurement of growth is going to flip the tables on our stability, and make us weak in the eyes of those enslaved mongrels." the secretary said. Schenck hardly had a tolerance for bureaucrats and con artists, and already, this young man's chippings at his mind was nearing Schenck to his limit. "What's the reports on the civilian and military industrial sectors? Aren't they experiencing positive outputs?" Schenck said, having to contain himself from an emotional lashing-out, for the security of his cover. "Sir, you are correct; however, to imagine that all we need is slight positive estimates is foolish, sir. Reichskommissariat Ostafrika is experiencing great economic values and an excess of resources to boot, it is imperative that we construct this treaty, as our desire for supremacy against the natives will be understood by Reichskommissar Hüttig, sir."\n\nSchenck continued to pace across his office. Oh, if only this kid knew the realities of the African continent. That his plan weighed on the willingness to cut his throat that day or not, whether it was for "the glory of the Reich" or whatever other nonsense this kid could come up with. Hüttig was a madman and the Nazis were cruel, sick monsters, to be sure; however, Schenck knew that inevitable failure brewed on the horizon if he did not maintain cover of his true beliefs, and Africa would be doomed to the monster of the East."
 ANG.76.a:0 "Request the treaty."

 ANG.77.t:0 "A Strange Request"
 ANG.77.desc:0 " Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, for as much as some could speak fondly of this cruel continent, could not find words to express his disdain for the accursed land, as he continued to bathe in what could have been a pleasant, sun-filled warmth in another life. However, Hüttig did not concern himself with the thoughts of such lowly and irresponsible men, those who would find themselves swayed by beauty or warmth; rather, Hans Hüttig had become focused on the true prize of Africa, the glory of supremacy over both the native and the German, as he pictured his rivals in his mind.\n\nThe image of Müller's and Schenck's plaguing Hüttig's mind gifted the man with a scowl, only getting worse as he continued to pursue for the bottle of brandy situated next to his bed, were it not for the series of knocks at the door. There, a young man dressed perfectly to Hüttig's standards came in, his secretary, and handed him a file in silence, knowing of his master's wrath. Hüttig confusingly browsed the contents to see what could have possibly been so important to reach his office in the midst of the workday. "From Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika?" Hüttig asked, being answered with a stern nod from his secretary.\n\nHüttig could hardly imagine the shock he'd receive upon opening the folder, as he saw an official transmission from the office of Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck. "A request for further cooperation...aid of civilian and military production...importation of slaves...weapons?" Hüttig continued to whisper to himself. For once in his waking life, he had seen the potential opportunity from his forced cooperation with his neighbors to the west. Wolfgang Schenck, that damned pilot, in pursuit of further ties with Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, for what? Was his Reichskommissariat in that desperate of a state that he could not help but to weakly beg on his knees, or was Schenck finally turning to take his position with a modicum of seriousness?\n\nThe rushing stream of thoughts crashed against the sides of Hüttig's mind. Of course, this could all be a trick, a ploy by Schenck to backstab Hüttig in a single moment of weakness. As the dreams of ambition over the dreams of a united, German Africa trickled down his mind as he remembered the secretary standing, awaiting an answer."

Now, the very soul of the continent was bleeding, as he remembered the industrial and slave-driven knife that had been plunged deep into the foreign land's heart. And all of it, every last minute, could be tied back to Hans Hüttig, Siegfried Müller, and Wolfgang Schenck himself, as he felt the burning of tears in his eyes.\n\nSchenck knew he could not afford such thoughts to be made public, of course, as he heard the slamming open of his office door and the marching jackboot of the Nazi entering his room. Turning, he saw the young, disciplined man carrying a manilla folder, saying, "From Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, sir." Schenck tore the folder from the kid's hand angrily, disturbed at the secretary's lack of decency. However, the contents of the folder would be a far more impactful experience for the Reichskommissar, as he saw the official transmission from the office of Hans Hüttig himself. Reading through the script as hastily as possible, Schenck's dry eyes spotted the approval of Schenck's proposal, with the statement "The Reichskommissariat Ostafrika humbly accepts the proposal for greater cooperation with her ally to the West, and will make immediate preparations to secure the agreement through the delivery of..." as Schenck's eyes wandered off, knowing the details did not matter.\n\nSchenck felt a wave of relief come over him, as he set the piece of paper down on his desk, which seemed to grow as tired of the workload as he had been. Sure, cooperating with that bastard Hüttig was not something to be enjoyed for Schenck; however, he knew that this was one short kneel in order to secure a better future for Africa.\n\nAs the thoughts of bettering the treatment of incoming slaves came rushing forward, Schenck remembered his secretary's evermore irritating, stuck-up expression, awaiting his response. "Dismissed." He nearly caught the young secretary rolling his eyes as he marched away."

Supplies will soon begin to arrive late, as others will be "mistakenly" seized by dissident groups within Ostafrika.\n\nSchenck sits comfortably in Windhoek, ready and willing to slowly lose this war of his."
 ANG.69.a:0 "They don't even know what's hitting them"
 ANG.76.desc:0 "Dear Mr. Hüttig,\n\nIn light of our recent alliance and collaboration, I thought it would be best to offer some assistance in terms of lightening your load with regards to your prisoner problem. We have heard that you have jailed and imprisoned the bandits under UNITA who have made numerous cross border raids into your territory. Similarly, they have been a thorn in our side as well, and we have our own fair share of experience in rehabilitating these individuals to make sure that they will not attempt such brazen acts of chaos and discord in the future. I am sure that these subhumans have received their due punishment under your vigilant and efficient administration. My request is that you should hand over some of these troublemakers so that you may focus your full attention on the war effort so as to equal the load under our new alliance. Attached to this letter are the formalities associated with who we would be OK to transfer over to our prisons. We thank you for your excellent efforts in winning the war for the Reich and for the Afrika-Schild.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWolfgang Schenck."
 ANG.80.t:0 "The Secret War"
 ANG.80.desc:0 "Far above and beyond the blood-soaked sands of South Africa's battlefields, an unsung war simmers.\n\nIn the cities and fields, cells of freedom fighters strike under night's cover and day's exposure, wearing worn, smuggled uniforms and carrying "gifts" from their benefactors in faraway America. Vengeance is their watchword, liberation their war cry, and the blood of fascists their gruesome calling card. Ammo caches, air fields, officers, homes -- no targets are spared from wrath long repressed, justly deserved.\n\nOn clear blue skies do the Luftwaffe fly fewer sorties, and when they do they soar to where their grace is needed least. "Where are the stukas?!" cry commandants in radio rooms filled with static noise and, a flash later, scattered dirt and bomb shrapnel. Trusted to turn the tide of war, the fearsome knights of the Reich were instead found wanting by the many corpses who lost its battles below. Desperate generals wonder if air support will ever be a given, rather than a dying wish.\n\nAnd in a Windhoek mansion's basement, a German listens to communiques and messages from a hundred men in a hundred places: Angola, the Congo, Mozambique, Langley Field. All operations are underway, they assure. A little more wetwork and misdirection, some more cracks in the fetid behemoth... and Africa will be free. Bleeding and rabid. But free.\n\nSchenk slouched heavy against his chair, dripping sweat from all pores. Despite the weight of a continent bearing upon him, the Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika cracked a grin."
 ANG.80.a:0 "Soon, a penitent man sighs, Africa will be free."

 #### Ideas

 ANG_Sudwest_Training_Shit:0 "Poor Südwestafrikaner Training"
 ANG_Sudwest_Training_Shit_desc:0 "The German administration of Südwestafrika never put many resources into training programs for native combatants, although even the pittance they allocated could be considered generous by the standards of their compatriots of the continent. Still, that fact does little to change the reality that our army is almost entirely green. We will have to do the best we can to ration out our best trained soldiers amongst our forces as the nucleus of our officer corps and assign them as instructors for the next generation of soldiers."
 ANG_Sudwest_Training_med:0 "Decent Südwestafrikaner Training"
 ANG_Sudwest_Training_med_desc:0 "Due to the not-insignificant amount of time and resources taken by the Südwest government to train our people in the twilight of its regime, our military forces are the most competent in the region. This will, we hope, allow us to maintain a powerful hand in foreign affairs with our neighbors. Our men have extensive training with standard field equipment and weapons, and because of the lengths our German trainers went to, we have many men with the skills to handle motorized and mechanized machines of war."
 ANG_Sudwest_Training_high:0 "Excellent Südwestafrikaner Training"
 ANG_Sudwest_Training_high_desc:0 "We have, if we are to boast, what may be the most competent native army in all of the African continent. We owe our professionalism to the government of the Südwestafrikaner regime, who, despite their colonial relationship with our people, were willing to divert entire divisions' worth of material and equipment for the purpose of training us in the skills of infantry, mechanized, and even specialized warfare. Whatever their motivations might have been, we owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have done to ensure the survival of the young Angolan state."
 ANG_constitution:0 "Angolan Constitution"
 ANG_constitution_desc:0 "We have seen the results of regimes that place authority into men and not institutions. We have only to remember Ostafrika where Hüttig ruled with the iron fist a kingdom of fear and terror, or to Zentralafrika where Müller's ignorance and apathy led to massive failures and collapse. Even our own former ruler, Reichskomissar Schenck flew above the clouds while hardly carrying for those stuck on the bare earth until the last moment. We will learn from these failures. The newly drafted Constitution of Angola has been careful to separate too much authority from any one individual or office. We have based our system on the one the American's are so rightly proud of, and have established an extensive system of checks and balances to maintain stability."
 ANG_Guerillas_Rescued:0 "Freed Guerillas"
 ANG_Guerillas_Rescued_desc:0 "The guerrilla fighters we have managed to free from the SS prisons of Ostafrika are now recuperated enough to be once more fit for combat. Fortunately for us, the vast majority have had their resolve strengthened by their time in the bowels of the beast. Their experience in the tactics of jungle warfare will make them excellent officers and NCOs for our new national army and hopefully they will keep us ahead of our regional rivals. At the same time, we can also use their particular talents in flushing out any remaining German troops still operating within our borders."
 ANG_few_prisoners_freed:0 "Marginal Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_few_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "Before their collapse, the regime here in southwest Africa only bothered to free a few of the more important political prisoners, most of whom had been languishing in camps for years if not over a decade in a few unfortunate cases. While their release will provide us with the nucleus of a functioning administration, we are still running a skeleton crew due to a severe lack of education provided to almost all natives. Hopefully these few pioneers of the Angolan state will be enough to guide us through the first few turbulent years while we rush to prepare a new generation for self-rule."
 ANG_med_prisoners_freed:0 "Large Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_med_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "In an unexpected move, the old Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika had made the decision to release almost half of the political prisoners that had been taken during the two decades of their occupation and administration. The released prisoners included influential local leaders who stood up for their people and even some with connections to the former Portugeuse colonial administration. We can now boast of a relatively stable political climate that should have enough seasoned members to ward off factional splintering or over centralization in the coming months and years and we lay the foundation for a government for the people of Angola, by the people of Angola."
 ANG_high_prisoners_freed:0 "Massive Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_high_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck presided over a colonial regime of racial superiority that would have had its end goal as the elimination of all "inferior peoples" from the African continent. By all sensible definitions, the man was an evil criminal. Despite that, we cannot now help but to hold some gratitude for his existence, for we have learned that it was by his order that over seventy percent of the total political prisoner population of the former Südwestafrikaner regime were freed. We do not know his reasons for doing this, and we do not really care. These prisoners will now be able to see the dream of a free Angola realized, and not only that, they will be able to see it thrive. The braintrust we have received defies calculation, as we have even received former prisoners from the former British and French colonies of Africa as well as those involved in the Portugeuese administration. The light of hope has once more been shined on the African continent, and we intend to take full advantage of the gift we have been given."
 ANG_German_Resistance:0 "German Resistance"
 ANG_German_Resistance_desc:0 "With the yoke of Germany's tyranny broken we can begin the long and difficult task of creating a prosperous nation for our people with the admittedly few materials we have left. Or we would, if we had no more pressing issues facing us that risk derailing our new nation before it even has a chance. While the German state may be dead, several garrisons and depots remain very much alive, and they promise to be a painful nuisance if not dealt with swiftly and decisively. They have a good deal of equipment and access that matches and even exceeds our army's by some accounts."
 ANG_Improved_Internal_Structure:0 "Improved Internal Structure"
 ANG_Improved_Internal_Structure_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply win the war for our independence. If we are to thrive as a free nation we must also invest time into constructing our political system. Currently, many factions are held back from all out war simply due to our common enemy. Therefore, we shall focus some of our attention away from the war effort in order to ensure that internal tensions do not flare out of control in the event of our victory."
 ANG_Mutual_Assistence_Pact_1:0 "The Mutual Assistance Agreement"
 ANG_Mutual_Assistence_Pact_1_desc:0 "The Airport of Afrika was never built to handle a land war, and beyond that, with our connection to the Vaterland cut we are going to run out of supplies and fuel sooner rather than later. That is, unless we actually cooperate with our fellow Reichskommisarriats. How helpful they'll end up being is questionable, after all, Hüttig seems to hate us with a passion, and Müller... well, we have no indication that Müller will necessarily care anymore about this life or death struggle than he ever did about running his colony. Still, if we can actually get them to take the pressure off of our land forces we can better fight the air war. Everyone will win."

The free nation of Angola once again faces the imminent threat of colonial subjugation for generations to come, and our foes have no wish to leave us to our self determination.\n\nIf our children are to live free, we must fight now.

If we conduct raids upon these arms depots, we can further arm our forces for the fight for our liberation."
